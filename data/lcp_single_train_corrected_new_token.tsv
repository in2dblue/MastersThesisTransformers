Right		N
from		N

that		N
we		N

package		N

On		N
its		N
mission		N
,		N
Parliament	0.302631578947368	C

the		N
initiatives	0.302631578947368	C
devised		N
by		N
several		N
Member		N
States		N
would		N
be		N
welcomed		N
and		N
extremely		N
useful		N
.		N

Since		N
that		N
time		N
,		N
the		N
European		N
Parliament		N
has		N
taken		N
part		N
in		N
repeated		N
initiatives	0.31578947368421	C
with		N
a		N
view		N
to		N
her		N
release		N
.		N

I		N
believe		N
the		N
Commission		N
and		N
the		N
incoming		N
presidency		N
should		N
take		N
clear		N
initiatives	0.4166666666666671	C
to		N
ensure		N
that		N
in		N
the		N
months		N

come		N
we		N
who		N
believe		N
in		N
Kyoto		N
should		N
seek		N
to		N
bring		N
it		N
to		N
a		N
satisfactory		N
definition		N
by		N
deepening		N
our		N
contact		N
with		N
Russia		N
,		N
and		N
I		N
made		N
that		N
point		N
also		N
this		N
weekend		N
.		N

However		N
,		N
we		N
shall		N
see		N
that		N
,		N
subject		N
to		N
a		N
few		N
clarifications	0.23214285714285698	C
,		N
in		N
principle		N
my		N
final		N
proposal		N
is		N
that		N
,		N
if		N
there		N
are		N
no		N
further		N
comments		N
,		N
all		N
these		N
nominations		N
should		N
be		N
approved		N
.		N

However		N
,		N
I		N
am		N
pleased		N
that		N
despite		N
these		N
challenges		N
we		N
managed		N
to		N
reach		N
a		N
compromise		N
that		N
confirms		N
the		N
basic		N
principles		N
of		N
the		N
Commission		N
's		N
proposal		N
,		N
such		N
as		N
the		N
extension		N
of		N
the		N
scope		N
to		N
energy-related		N
products		N
,		N
but		N
also		N
brings		N
more		N
clarifications	0.279411764705882	C
and		N
more		N
emphasis		N
on		N
all		N
relevant		N
environmental		N
parameters		N
.		N

The		N
proposal		N
contains		N
a		N
set		N
of		N
very		N
important		N
principles		N
and		N
clarifications	0.294117647058823	C
of		N
rules		N
that		N
border		N
guards		N
must		N
apply		N
when		N
controlling		N
sea		N
borders		N
,		N
for		N
example		N
,		N
the		N
principle		N
of		N
non-refoulement		N
and		N
the		N
obligation		N
to		N
treat		N
vulnerable		N
peoples		N
and		N
unaccompanied		N
minors		N
with		N
special		N
care		N
.		N

We		N
should		N
therefore		N
be		N
proud		N
that		N
we		N
finally		N
gave		N
consent		N
to		N
the		N
agreement		N
that		N
is		N
so		N
important		N
for		N
efforts		N
to		N
track		N
terrorist		N
activities		N
,		N
especially		N
since		N
the		N
new		N
agreement		N
contains		N
significant		N
improvements		N
,		N
and		N
clarifications	0.3125	C
made		N
by		N

been		N

would		N

For		N
these		N
reasons		N
,		N
I		N
think		N
that		N
this		N
initiative		N
is		N
a		N
further		N
step		N
towards		N
the		N
realisation	0.294117647058823	C
of		N
the		N
European		N
Research		N
Area		N
.		N

Today		N
's		N
amendment		N
to		N
the		N
directive		N
as		N
regards		N
vaccination		N
against		N
bluetongue		N
is		N
a		N
practical		N
realisation	0.375	C
of		N
this		N
very		N
principle		N
.		N

Too		N
often		N
,		N
what		N
we		N
see		N
is		N
a		N
realisation	0.4	C
of		N
the		N
urgency		N
of		N
the		N
situation		N
and		N
a		N
juxtaposition		N
of		N
national		N
solutions		N
that		N
are		N
then		N
dressed		N
up		N
as		N
a		N
European		N
solution		N
.		N

I		N
therefore		N
believe		N
that		N
we		N
need		N
to		N
have		N
the		N
courage		N
to		N
tear		N
down		N
the		N
walls		N

enterprise		N
and		N
business		N
and		N
the		N

and		N
allow		N
entrepreneurs	0.294117647058823	C
to		N
provide		N
aid		N
in		N
a		N
way		N
that		N
is		N
different		N
from		N
the		N
way		N
we		N
have		N
provided		N
it		N
in		N
the		N
past		N
.		N

That		N
proposal		N
for		N
compromise		N
is		N
founded		N
on		N
some		N
of		N
the		N
resistance		N
from		N
the		N
Council		N
of		N
Ministers	0.294117647058823	C
,		N
and		N
it		N
disappoints		N
me		N
that		N
the		N
Council		N
Presidency		N
is		N
not		N
represented		N
here		N
tonight		N

I		N
hope		N
that		N
the		N
Ministers	0.323529411764706	C
adopt		N
this		N

today		N
and		N
that		N
it		N
contains		N
reference		N
to		N
this		N

These		N
and		N

were		N

like		N
to		N
highlight		N
the		N
issue		N
regarding		N

This		N
is		N
reflected		N
in		N
the		N
Commission		N
's		N
communication		N
of		N
April		N
2010		N
on		N
the		N
Stockholm		N

,		N
which		N
puts		N
emphasis	0.297619047619048	C
on		N
the		N
protection		N

can		N
an		N
emphasis	0.323529411764706	C

justify		N

In		N
that		N
resolution		N

we		N
upheld		N
the		N
importance		N

for		N

placed		N
major		N

on		N

I		N
regret		N
that		N
our		N
Parliament		N
has		N
been		N
unable		N
to		N
devote		N
sufficient		N
time		N
to		N

drafting		N

Similarly		N
,		N
the		N

and		N
to		N
the		N
protection		N
of		N

at		N

Firstly		N

would		N
like		N
to		N
point		N
out		N
that		N
the		N

has		N
two		N
different		N
scopes	0.41071428571428603	C
:		N
the		N
first		N
is		N
to		N
describe		N
and		N
assess		N
the		N
situation		N
,		N
which		N
is		N
unfortunately		N
a		N
negative		N
one		N
,		N
of		N
human		N
rights		N
in		N
many		N
countries		N
and		N
regions		N
of		N
the		N
world		N
,		N
often		N
bordering		N
on		N
or		N
entering		N
into		N
the		N
territory		N
of		N
human		N
tragedy		N
;		N
the		N
second		N
is		N
an		N
assessment		N
based		N
on		N
the		N
past		N
experience		N
of		N
this		N

Anybody		N

what		N

The		N

the		N
Council		N

the		N
Commission		N
on		N

I		N
think		N
it		N
is		N
very		N
important		N
to		N
add		N
that		N
more		N
should		N
be		N
spent		N
on		N
the		N
professionalism		N

because		N
the		N
lives		N

safety		N

Since		N

in		N

may		N

The		N
reason		N

was		N
slightly		N

that		N

the		N
