After	N
playing	N
football	N
with	N
my	N
friends	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
all	N
sweaty	N
and	N
dirty	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
decide	N
I	N
should	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N
	
First	N
I	N
made	N
sure	N
there	N
were	N
clean	N
towels	N
available	N
and	N
enough	N
soap	N
and	N
shampoo	N
to	N
thoroughly	C
clean	N
my	N
skin	N
and	N
hair	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
the	N
plug	N
in	N
the	N
bottom	N
of	N
the	N
bath	N
tub	N
and	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
water	N
,	N
being	N
careful	N
to	N
adjust	C
the	N
water	N
to	N
a	N
nice	N
warm	N
,	N
but	N
no	N
too	N
hot	N
,	N
temperature	N
.	N
	
I	N
used	N
my	N
finger	N
to	N
determine	C
just	N
the	N
right	N
temperature	N
.	N
	
After	N
removing	N
my	N
clothes	N
and	N
placing	N
them	N
in	N
the	N
hamper	N
,	N
I	N
carefully	N
stepped	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
,	N
being	N
sure	N
to	N
steady	C
myself	N
as	N
I	N
entered	N
.	N
	
I	N
gingerly	N
lowered	N
myself	N
into	N
the	N
nice	N
warm	N
water	N
and	N
immediately	N
began	N
to	N
relax	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
of	N
rest	N
and	N
relaxation	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
out	N
the	N
soap	N
and	N
thoroughly	C
washed	N
my	N
whole	N
body	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
to	N
get	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
dirt	N
and	N
grass	N
stains	N
off	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
accumulated	N
from	N
playing	N
football	N
.	N
	
Next	N
I	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
with	N
shampoo	N
and	N
laid	N
back	N
into	N
the	N
water	N
to	N
really	N
rinse	N
it	N
out	N
well	N
.	N
	
I	N
carefully	N
exited	N
the	N
bath	N
tub	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
to	N
step	N
onto	N
the	N
bath	N
mat	C
so	N
I	N
would	N
n't	N
slip	N
on	N
the	N
smooth	N
floor	N
tiles	N
,	N
and	N
got	N
a	N
towel	N
and	N
dried	N
myself	N
off	N
.	N
	
Now	N
my	N
bath	N
was	N
complete	N
and	N
I	N
felt	N
so	N
nice	N
and	N
clean	N
!	N
What	N
a	N
great	N
feeling	N
!	N
I	N
like	N
taking	N
a	N
bath	N
instead	N
of	N
a	N
shower	N
sometimes	N
.	N
	
I	N
start	N
by	N
closing	N
the	N
drain	C
at	N
the	N
bottom	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
Some	N
tubs	N
have	N
a	N
stopper	N
and	N
some	N
have	N
a	N
thing	N
you	N
push	N
down	N
to	N
close	N
it	N
.	N
	
After	N
it	N
's	N
closed	N
I	N
like	N
to	N
run	N
both	N
hot	N
and	N
cold	N
water	N
to	N
make	N
warm	N
water	N
and	N
then	N
I	N
let	N
the	N
tub	N
fill	N
up	N
to	N
about	N
a	N
hand	N
's	N
height	N
from	N
the	N
top	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
While	N
the	N
water	N
is	N
running	N
,	N
I	N
squirt	N
in	N
bubbles	N
and	N
make	N
sure	N
I	N
have	N
a	N
clean	N
washcloth	N
and	N
towel	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
carefully	N
climb	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
,	N
I	N
make	N
sure	N
I	N
wash	N
my	N
whole	N
body	N
with	N
the	N
soap	N
and	N
washcloth	N
,	N
even	N
behind	N
my	N
ears	N
and	N
between	N
my	N
toes	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
can	N
either	N
soak	C
and	N
relax	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
or	N
I	N
can	N
play	N
with	N
toys	N
.	N
	
Fun	N
toys	N
for	N
the	N
bathtub	N
are	N
boats	N
and	N
plastic	N
water	N
animals	N
like	N
whales	N
and	N
ducks	N
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
water	N
starts	N
to	N
turn	N
a	N
little	N
cold	N
,	N
it	N
's	N
time	N
to	N
get	N
out	N
so	N
I	N
open	N
the	N
drain	C
again	N
and	N
let	N
the	N
water	N
empty	N
out	N
.	N
	
While	N
it	N
's	N
draining	N
I	N
carefully	N
stand	N
up	N
and	N
reach	N
for	N
my	N
towel	N
to	N
dry	N
off	N
.	N
	
I	N
always	N
be	N
sure	N
the	N
tub	N
is	N
clean	N
when	N
I	N
'm	N
finished	N
,	N
with	N
toys	N
and	N
the	N
dirty	N
washcloth	N
put	N
where	N
they	N
belong	C
.	N
	
Last	N
night	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N
	
I	N
take	N
baths	N
when	N
I	N
have	N
time	N
to	N
relax	N
and	N
soak	C
in	N
bubbles	N
.	N
	
Baths	N
are	N
important	N
for	N
good	N
hygiene	C
and	N
self	C
esteem	N
.	N
	
I	N
always	N
feel	N
so	N
much	N
better	N
when	N
I	N
am	N
clean	N
and	N
smell	N
like	N
my	N
favorite	N
soap	N
.	N
	
I	N
like	N
to	N
fill	N
the	N
tub	N
up	N
as	N
full	N
as	N
I	N
can	N
and	N
pick	N
a	N
shower	N
gel	N
or	N
bubble	C
bath	N
to	N
make	N
lots	N
and	N
lots	N
of	N
bubbles	N
.	N
	
I	N
just	N
soak	C
in	N
the	N
bubbles	N
and	N
enjoy	N
the	N
time	N
to	N
myself	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
wash	N
my	N
hair	N
with	N
shampoo	N
and	N
conditioner	N
.	N
	
Next	N
,	N
I	N
make	N
sure	N
to	N
scrub	N
everywhere	N
from	N
between	N
my	N
toes	N
to	N
behind	N
my	N
ears	N
with	N
soap	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
,	N
I	N
am	N
ready	N
to	N
dry	N
off	N
and	N
get	N
into	N
some	N
clean	N
clothes	N
.	N
	
If	N
I	N
do	N
n't	N
have	N
time	N
for	N
a	N
bath	N
,	N
I	N
just	N
take	N
a	N
shower	N
.	N
	
Showers	N
are	N
much	N
faster	N
!	N
No	N
matter	N
what	N
I	N
choose	N
,	N
I	N
make	N
sure	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
or	N
a	N
shower	N
every	N
day	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
into	N
my	N
bathroom	N
and	N
started	N
to	N
run	N
the	N
bath	N
,	N
letting	N
the	N
water	N
get	N
warm	N
enough	N
.	N
	
Once	N
warm	N
,	N
I	N
plugged	N
up	N
the	N
drain	C
and	N
the	N
bath	N
began	N
to	N
fill	N
.	N
	
I	N
dripped	N
some	N
bubble	C
bath	N
into	N
the	N
water	N
to	N
get	N
it	N
nice	N
and	N
bubbly	N
.	N
	
Suds	N
filled	N
the	N
tub	N
along	N
with	N
warm	N
water	N
,	N
creating	N
a	N
heavenly	C
scent	C
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
tub	N
was	N
filled	N
,	N
I	N
disrobed	N
and	N
got	N
in	N
.	N
	
I	N
sat	N
for	N
a	N
moment	N
,	N
relaxing	N
,	N
allowing	N
the	N
warm	N
water	N
to	N
sooth	N
my	N
skin	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
few	N
moments	N
,	N
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
bar	N
of	N
soap	N
and	N
lathered	N
my	N
body	N
.	N
	
I	N
washed	N
myself	N
carefully	N
because	N
I	N
did	N
not	N
want	N
to	N
spill	N
water	N
onto	N
the	N
floor	N
.	N
	
I	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
dunked	N
my	N
head	N
under	N
water	N
to	N
clear	N
the	N
shampoo	N
and	N
conditioner	N
.	N
	
After	N
awhile	N
the	N
water	N
began	N
to	N
cool	N
.	N
	
Since	N
I	N
was	N
done	N
washing	N
,	N
I	N
unplugged	N
the	N
drain	C
and	N
let	N
the	N
water	N
drain	C
out	N
.	N
	
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
towel	N
and	N
dried	N
off	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
left	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
Each	N
night	N
after	N
we	N
finish	N
eating	N
our	N
dinner	N
,	N
I	N
go	N
upstairs	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N
	
The	N
first	N
thing	N
that	N
I	N
do	N
is	N
get	N
myself	N
a	N
clean	N
towel	N
and	N
wash	N
cloth	C
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
these	N
items	N
on	N
the	N
side	N
of	N
the	N
bath	N
tub	N
in	N
my	N
bathroom	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
put	N
the	N
stopper	N
in	N
the	N
drain	C
of	N
the	N
bathtub	N
and	N
turn	N
on	N
the	N
water	N
faucet	N
.	N
	
I	N
wait	N
for	N
the	N
water	N
to	N
warm	N
up	N
and	N
check	N
it	N
with	N
my	N
hand	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
it	N
is	N
warm	N
and	N
not	N
too	N
hot	N
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
bath	N
tub	N
is	N
half	N
way	N
full	N
,	N
I	N
turn	N
off	N
the	N
water	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
take	N
off	N
my	N
clothes	N
and	N
climb	N
into	N
the	N
bath	N
tub	N
.	N
	
I	N
get	N
my	N
wash	N
cloth	C
and	N
put	N
it	N
under	N
the	N
water	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
get	N
the	N
soap	N
and	N
rub	C
it	N
on	N
my	N
wet	N
wash	N
cloth	C
to	N
make	N
suds	N
.	N
	
The	N
next	N
thing	N
to	N
do	N
is	N
take	N
the	N
wash	N
cloth	C
and	N
wash	N
my	N
entire	C
body	N
,	N
starting	N
with	N
my	N
face	N
and	N
ending	N
with	N
my	N
toes	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
have	N
washed	N
everything	N
,	N
I	N
rinse	N
the	N
soap	N
from	N
my	N
body	N
with	N
the	N
water	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
,	N
I	N
get	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
,	N
take	N
the	N
stopper	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
drain	C
to	N
let	N
the	N
water	N
out	N
,	N
and	N
use	N
my	N
towel	N
to	N
dry	N
off	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
yesterday	N
afternoon	N
after	N
working	N
out	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
got	N
back	N
home	N
,	N
I	N
walked	N
to	N
my	N
bathroom	N
and	N
first	N
quickly	N
scrubbed	N
the	N
bathroom	N
tub	N
by	N
turning	N
on	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
rinsing	N
it	N
clean	N
with	N
a	N
rag	N
.	N
	
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
finished	N
,	N
I	N
plugged	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
began	N
filling	N
it	N
with	N
warm	N
water	N
set	N
at	N
about	N
98	N
degrees	N
.	N
	
While	N
waiting	N
for	N
the	N
tub	N
to	N
fill	N
up	N
,	N
I	N
undressed	C
and	N
closed	N
the	N
bathroom	N
door	N
.	N
	
About	N
5	N
minutes	N
later	N
,	N
the	N
tub	N
was	N
filled	N
up	N
and	N
I	N
shut	N
off	N
the	N
water	N
.	N
	
I	N
briefly	N
tested	N
the	N
water	N
with	N
my	N
elbow	N
and	N
then	N
stepped	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
to	N
lay	N
down	N
.	N
	
For	N
about	N
25	N
minutes	N
,	N
I	N
lay	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
relaxed	N
by	N
closing	N
my	N
eyes	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
also	N
took	N
the	N
time	N
to	N
read	N
pages	N
of	N
a	N
book	N
I	N
had	N
brought	N
with	N
me	N
.	N
	
Once	N
my	N
body	N
was	N
totally	N
relaxed	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
quick	N
shower	N
to	N
rinse	N
myself	N
off	N
and	N
then	N
drained	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
Next	N
,	N
I	N
dried	N
myself	N
off	N
with	N
a	N
towel	N
and	N
put	N
my	N
clothes	N
back	N
on	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
great	N
relaxing	N
experience	N
after	N
exercising	N
in	N
the	N
cold	N
winter	N
day	N
.	N
	
Last	N
night	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N
	
I	N
chose	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
because	N
I	N
find	N
it	N
to	N
be	N
more	N
relaxing	N
at	N
bed	N
time	N
than	N
taking	N
a	N
shower	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
my	N
hair	N
up	N
in	N
a	N
bun	C
so	N
it	N
would	N
stay	N
dry	N
.	N
	
I	N
stuck	C
the	N
stopper	N
in	N
the	N
drain	C
so	N
the	N
water	N
would	N
stay	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
I	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
faucets	N
and	N
felt	N
the	N
water	N
until	N
I	N
had	N
the	N
right	N
temperature	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
the	N
bath	N
a	N
little	N
hot	N
so	N
it	N
would	N
n't	N
get	N
cold	N
too	N
fast	N
.	N
	
While	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
running	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
the	N
bottle	N
of	N
bubble	C
bath	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
closet	N
.	N
	
I	N
opened	N
it	N
up	N
and	N
squirted	N
a	N
little	N
bit	N
of	N
bubble	C
bath	N
under	N
the	N
running	N
water	N
so	N
the	N
water	N
would	N
get	N
nice	N
and	N
foamy	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
took	N
out	N
a	N
fresh	N
towel	N
and	N
a	N
loofah	N
sponge	N
.	N
	
I	N
stepped	N
over	N
the	N
edge	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
sunk	N
into	N
the	N
water	N
slowly	N
.	N
	
The	N
hot	N
water	N
felt	N
so	N
good	N
on	N
my	N
skin	N
and	N
I	N
instantly	C
felt	N
relaxed	N
.	N
	
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
bar	N
of	N
soap	N
and	N
rubbed	N
some	N
on	N
my	N
loofah	N
before	N
scrubbing	N
down	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
good	N
scrub	N
,	N
I	N
soaked	C
in	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
relaxed	N
for	N
a	N
good	N
twenty	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
stopper	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
sat	N
there	N
while	N
the	N
water	N
went	N
down	N
.	N
	
After	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
almost	N
all	N
gone	N
,	N
I	N
very	N
carefully	N
stood	N
up	N
and	N
blotted	N
myself	N
dry	N
with	N
a	N
towel	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
,	N
I	N
put	N
on	N
my	N
bathrobe	N
and	N
headed	N
to	N
my	N
room	N
.	N
	
Last	N
night	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N
	
First	N
,	N
I	N
plugged	N
the	N
bath	N
drain	C
.	N
	
Then	N
,	N
I	N
filled	N
the	N
bathtub	N
with	N
warm	N
water	N
.	N
	
I	N
poured	N
some	N
bubble	C
bath	N
mixture	C
into	N
the	N
tub	N
while	N
the	N
bath	N
was	N
filling	N
so	N
that	N
my	N
bath	N
would	N
have	N
bubbles	N
.	N
	
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
got	N
undressed	C
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
bath	N
was	N
full	N
,	N
I	N
turned	N
off	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
climbed	N
into	N
the	N
warm	N
tub	N
.	N
	
I	N
felt	N
very	N
relaxed	N
as	N
I	N
lay	N
in	N
the	N
warm	N
bubble	C
bath	N
.	N
	
I	N
shut	N
my	N
eyes	N
for	N
a	N
moment	N
to	N
enjoy	N
the	N
sensation	C
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
,	N
lathering	N
the	N
shampoo	N
into	N
my	N
hair	N
,	N
then	N
rinsing	N
it	N
off	N
in	N
the	N
bath	N
water	N
.	N
	
Next	N
,	N
I	N
washed	N
my	N
whole	N
body	N
with	N
a	N
bar	N
of	N
soap	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
was	N
completely	N
clean	N
,	N
I	N
stepped	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
bath	N
and	N
wrapped	N
a	N
towel	N
around	N
myself	N
.	N
	
I	N
wrapped	N
a	N
second	N
towel	N
around	N
my	N
hair	N
to	N
keep	N
it	N
from	N
dripping	N
everywhere	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
unplugged	N
the	N
bath	N
drain	C
to	N
let	N
the	N
water	N
drain	C
out	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
Taking	N
a	N
bath	N
can	N
be	N
a	N
very	N
relaxing	N
thing	N
to	N
do	N
especially	N
right	N
before	N
bed	N
.	N
	
You	N
can	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
to	N
clean	N
yourself	N
or	N
just	N
to	N
soak	C
and	N
relax	N
but	N
both	N
can	N
be	N
an	N
enjoyable	N
experience	N
.	N
	
Get	N
your	N
needed	N
items	N
together	N
first	N
.	N
	
This	N
will	N
include	N
a	N
towel	N
for	N
drying	N
off	N
and	N
any	N
personal	N
body	N
supplies	N
such	C
as	N
soaps	N
.	N
	
You	N
may	N
want	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
quick	N
shower	N
off	N
first	N
so	N
that	N
your	N
bath	N
water	N
stays	N
clean	N
as	N
you	N
soak	C
.	N
	
You	N
will	N
want	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
the	N
tub	N
is	N
clean	N
first	N
and	N
you	N
might	N
want	N
to	N
wipe	C
the	N
bottom	N
and	N
sides	N
off	N
.	N
	
When	N
you	N
are	N
ready	N
for	N
your	N
bath	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
first	N
fill	N
your	N
tub	N
with	N
water	N
using	N
a	N
temperature	N
you	N
find	N
pleasant	N
but	N
make	N
sure	N
you	N
have	N
put	N
the	N
plug	N
in	N
so	N
your	N
water	N
does	N
not	N
drain	C
away	N
.	N
	
Its	N
nice	N
to	N
use	N
bubble	C
bath	N
,	N
or	N
bath	N
salts	N
,	N
or	N
even	N
bath	N
oils	N
.	N
	
When	N
taking	N
a	N
bath	N
setting	C
a	N
relaxing	N
atmosphere	N
is	N
also	N
nice	N
.	N
	
You	N
can	N
turn	N
on	N
some	N
soothing	C
music	N
.	N
	
Candle	N
in	N
the	N
room	N
and	N
around	N
the	N
tub	N
are	N
always	N
nice	N
too	N
.	N
	
We	N
had	N
just	N
come	N
home	N
from	N
the	N
beach	N
one	N
Saturday	N
afternoon	N
.	N
	
We	N
had	N
a	N
great	N
time	N
,	N
but	N
were	N
very	N
sweaty	N
,	N
sandy	N
and	N
sticky	N
with	N
old	N
sunscreen	N
,	N
sweat	C
and	N
salt	N
from	N
the	N
ocean	N
.	N
	
After	N
unpacking	N
the	N
car	N
,	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N
	
I	N
love	N
our	N
deep	N
soaking	C
tub	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
in	N
the	N
drain	C
plug	N
and	N
started	N
running	N
the	N
water	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
the	N
temperature	N
of	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
just	N
right	N
,	N
and	N
put	N
in	N
my	N
favorite	N
bath	N
scents	N
and	N
soap	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
tub	N
was	N
full	N
,	N
I	N
immersed	N
myself	N
deep	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
just	N
let	N
my	N
body	N
soak	C
for	N
a	N
while	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
good	N
to	N
sit	N
in	N
the	N
nice	N
,	N
warm	N
water	N
and	N
let	N
everything	N
just	N
relax	N
and	N
melt	C
away	N
from	N
me	N
.	N
	
I	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
with	N
my	N
favorite	N
shampoo	N
,	N
as	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
lot	N
of	N
sand	N
in	N
it	N
from	N
playing	N
at	N
the	N
beach	N
that	N
day	N
.	N
	
I	N
scrubbed	N
my	N
body	N
well	N
with	N
a	N
washcloth	N
,	N
to	N
get	N
off	N
all	N
the	N
sand	N
and	N
ocean	N
salt	N
that	N
had	N
dried	N
on	N
my	N
skin	N
,	N
along	N
with	N
the	N
sunscreen	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
been	N
using	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
very	N
relaxing	N
and	N
I	N
felt	N
really	N
good	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
pulled	N
the	N
drain	C
on	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
let	N
all	N
the	N
dirty	N
water	N
go	N
down	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
a	N
big	N
,	N
fluffy	N
bath	N
towel	N
that	N
I	N
dried	N
off	N
in	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
put	N
on	N
clean	N
clothes	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
ready	N
to	N
finish	N
up	N
our	N
fun	N
day	N
with	N
some	N
dinner	N
and	N
good	N
times	C
with	N
my	N
family	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
long	N
day	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N
	
I	N
changed	N
out	N
of	N
my	N
clothes	N
into	N
a	N
plush	N
bathrobe	N
.	N
	
I	N
placed	N
a	N
plug	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
drain	C
so	N
the	N
tub	N
could	N
fill	N
up	N
.	N
	
I	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
adjusted	N
it	N
so	N
it	N
was	N
just	N
the	N
right	N
temperature	N
-	N
hot	N
,	N
but	N
not	N
too	N
hot	N
.	N
	
I	N
sprinkled	N
in	N
some	N
lavender	N
scented	N
bath	N
salts	N
to	N
make	N
it	N
extra	N
relaxing	N
.	N
	
It	N
took	N
about	N
five	N
minutes	N
for	N
the	N
whole	N
tub	N
to	N
fill	N
up	N
.	N
	
I	N
did	N
n't	N
fill	N
it	N
all	N
the	N
way	N
to	N
the	N
top	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
to	N
leave	N
some	N
room	N
since	N
I	N
'd	N
be	N
getting	N
in	N
.	N
	
When	N
it	N
was	N
ready	N
,	N
I	N
dipped	N
my	N
toe	N
in	N
first	N
,	N
testing	N
out	N
the	N
water	N
.	N
	
I	N
hung	N
my	N
robe	N
on	N
the	N
back	N
of	N
the	N
door	N
,	N
and	N
got	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
I	N
eased	N
in	N
slowly	N
since	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
hot	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
nestled	N
in	N
to	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
washed	N
myself	N
with	N
a	N
washcloth	N
and	N
soap	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
leaned	N
my	N
head	N
against	N
the	N
rim	N
of	N
the	N
bathtub	N
.	N
	
I	N
breathed	N
in	N
the	N
aroma	N
of	N
lavender	N
,	N
closed	N
my	N
eyes	N
,	N
and	N
felt	N
my	N
body	N
and	N
mind	N
completely	N
relax	N
.	N
	
After	N
going	N
to	N
the	N
gym	N
,	N
I	N
knew	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
bathroom	N
and	N
turned	N
the	N
faucet	N
on	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
while	N
plugging	N
the	N
drain	C
to	N
fill	N
it	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
at	N
a	N
good	N
level	N
I	N
shut	N
the	N
water	N
off	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
off	N
all	N
my	N
dirty	N
gym	N
clothes	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
made	N
sure	N
the	N
temperature	N
of	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
nice	N
and	N
warm	N
before	N
I	N
slowly	N
got	N
inside	N
.	N
	
I	N
soaked	C
in	N
the	N
water	N
for	N
a	N
little	N
while	N
before	N
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
bar	N
of	N
soap	N
and	N
scrubbed	N
and	N
cleaned	N
my	N
body	N
with	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
also	N
used	N
some	N
shampoo	N
to	N
clean	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
After	N
dipping	N
into	N
the	N
water	N
to	N
rinse	N
all	N
the	N
shampoo	N
and	N
soap	N
off	N
my	N
body	N
,	N
I	N
unplugged	N
the	N
drain	C
and	N
emptied	N
the	N
water	N
from	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
out	N
and	N
dried	N
myself	N
with	N
a	N
towel	N
.	N
	
It	N
sure	N
made	N
me	N
feel	N
a	N
lot	N
better	N
to	N
be	N
clean	N
after	N
a	N
workout	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
long	N
day	N
of	N
work	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
very	N
sore	N
and	N
tired	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
stood	N
for	N
five	N
hours	N
straight	N
and	N
was	N
constantly	C
helping	N
customers	N
on	N
the	N
ground	N
floor	N
.	N
	
Retail	C
is	N
difficult	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
painful	N
for	N
my	N
feet	N
because	N
I	N
often	N
had	N
to	N
wear	N
high	N
heels	N
everyday	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
finally	N
got	N
home	N
from	N
work	N
,	N
I	N
put	N
my	N
stuff	N
down	N
and	N
began	N
to	N
change	N
into	N
more	N
comfortable	N
attire	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
did	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
bathroom	N
and	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
hot	N
water	N
to	N
prepare	N
my	N
bath	N
.	N
	
While	N
that	N
happened	N
,	N
I	N
washed	N
my	N
face	N
and	N
took	N
the	N
makeup	N
off	N
my	N
face	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
cleaned	N
my	N
face	N
,	N
I	N
crawled	N
into	N
the	N
shower	N
and	N
allowed	N
the	N
hot	N
water	N
to	N
calm	N
my	N
body	N
down	N
and	N
help	N
me	N
relax	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
shampoo	N
on	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
massaged	N
my	N
scalp	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
placed	N
conditioner	N
on	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
lathered	N
it	N
all	N
over	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
washed	N
it	N
off	N
and	N
focused	N
on	N
washing	N
my	N
body	N
.	N
	
After	N
washing	N
my	N
body	N
,	N
and	N
rinsing	N
off	N
the	N
soap	N
suds	N
,	N
I	N
simply	C
let	N
the	N
hot	N
water	N
go	N
all	N
over	N
my	N
body	N
and	N
allowed	N
it	N
to	N
help	N
me	N
relax	N
.	N
	
I	N
needed	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N
	
I	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
cold	N
and	N
hot	N
taps	N
to	N
let	N
the	N
bathtub	N
fill	N
with	N
warm	N
water	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
got	N
a	N
towel	N
and	N
draped	N
it	N
over	N
the	N
curtain	N
rod	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
off	N
my	N
clothes	N
and	N
grabbed	N
my	N
favorite	N
rubber	N
ducky	N
from	N
a	N
shelf	N
.	N
	
I	N
dropped	N
him	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
If	N
I	N
needed	N
a	N
bath	N
,	N
so	N
did	N
he	N
.	N
	
I	N
also	N
poured	N
some	N
bubble	C
bath	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
as	N
it	N
was	N
filling	N
with	N
water	N
.	N
	
It	N
foamed	N
up	N
into	N
lots	N
of	N
bubbles	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
tub	N
was	N
full	N
enough	N
,	N
I	N
turned	N
off	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
got	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
,	N
being	N
careful	N
not	N
to	N
slip	N
on	N
the	N
slippery	C
porcelain	N
.	N
	
I	N
lay	N
back	N
in	N
the	N
warm	N
water	N
and	N
shut	N
my	N
eyes	N
,	N
relaxing	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
water	N
started	N
to	N
get	N
cold	N
,	N
I	N
stood	N
up	N
and	N
grabbed	N
the	N
towel	N
from	N
the	N
curtain	N
rod	N
.	N
	
I	N
draped	N
it	N
around	N
myself	N
and	N
then	N
opened	N
the	N
tub	N
's	N
drain	C
so	N
the	N
water	N
could	N
drain	C
out	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
off	N
to	N
get	N
dressed	N
,	N
and	N
when	N
I	N
was	N
done	N
I	N
went	N
back	N
to	N
the	N
bathroom	N
and	N
turned	N
the	N
shower	N
on	N
for	N
a	N
minute	N
so	N
the	N
bubbles	N
would	N
all	N
go	N
down	N
the	N
drain	C
.	N
	
I	N
picked	N
up	N
my	N
rubber	N
ducky	N
and	N
gave	N
him	N
a	N
squeeze	C
until	N
he	N
quacked	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
put	N
him	N
on	N
the	N
shelf	N
until	N
next	N
time	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
long	N
day	N
of	N
work	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N
	
First	N
I	N
put	N
on	N
some	N
good	N
relaxing	N
acoustic	N
music	N
to	N
listen	N
to	N
while	N
I	N
took	N
the	N
bath	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
got	N
the	N
water	N
nice	N
and	N
hot	N
and	N
then	N
stopped	N
the	N
drain	C
.	N
	
After	N
the	N
tub	N
was	N
full	N
I	N
added	N
lavender	N
bubbles	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
a	N
tray	C
to	N
place	N
across	N
the	N
bath	N
with	N
my	N
wine	N
and	N
a	N
magazine	N
and	N
some	N
chocolate	N
.	N
	
I	N
sank	N
into	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
sighed	N
with	N
relief	C
.	N
	
I	N
drank	N
three	N
glasses	N
of	N
wine	N
and	N
haphazardly	N
paged	N
through	N
the	N
magazine	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
was	N
done	N
with	N
my	N
bath	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
plug	N
and	N
drained	N
the	N
water	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
shower	N
to	N
rinse	N
myself	N
off	N
.	N
	
Once	N
all	N
the	N
soap	N
was	N
off	N
I	N
stepped	N
out	N
.	N
	
I	N
dried	N
off	N
and	N
then	N
put	N
on	N
my	N
robe	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
now	N
done	N
taking	N
a	N
bath	N
and	N
was	N
ready	N
for	N
bed	N
.	N
	
For	N
me	N
there	N
is	N
nothing	N
more	N
relaxing	N
then	N
taking	N
a	N
nice	N
hot	N
bath	N
after	N
a	N
long	N
day	N
of	N
work	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
got	N
home	N
the	N
first	N
thing	N
I	N
did	N
was	N
start	N
the	N
running	N
water	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
the	N
temperature	N
was	N
perfect	N
before	N
putting	N
the	N
drain	C
stopper	N
in	N
place	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
went	N
to	N
my	N
room	N
and	N
got	N
some	N
clean	N
clothes	N
and	N
a	N
towel	N
from	N
the	N
closet	N
.	N
	
I	N
like	N
to	N
listen	N
to	N
music	N
when	N
I	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
so	N
I	N
brought	N
along	N
my	N
i-pod	N
and	N
small	N
speakers	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
tub	N
was	N
almost	N
filled	N
I	N
stop	N
the	N
water	N
,	N
turned	N
the	N
music	N
on	N
,	N
and	N
stepped	N
inside	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
like	N
a	N
little	N
piece	N
of	N
heaven	C
as	N
the	N
warm	N
water	N
washed	N
over	N
my	N
body	N
.	N
	
After	N
about	N
10	N
minutes	N
of	N
relaxing	N
I	N
found	C
the	N
soap	N
and	N
started	N
to	N
apply	N
it	N
all	N
over	N
my	N
body	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
was	N
finished	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
drain	C
stopper	N
and	N
started	N
to	N
rinse	N
the	N
soap	N
off	N
.	N
	
After	N
all	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
drained	N
I	N
grabbed	N
my	N
towel	N
and	N
started	N
to	N
dry	N
off	N
,	N
then	N
I	N
finally	N
slipped	N
into	N
my	N
clean	N
clothes	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
so	N
relaxing	N
,	N
I	N
just	N
ca	N
n't	N
wait	N
to	N
do	N
it	N
again	N
very	N
soon	N
.	N
	
Last	N
week	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
nice	N
relaxing	N
bubble	C
bath	N
after	N
a	N
hard	N
day	N
of	N
work	N
.	N
	
After	N
getting	N
done	N
with	N
my	N
chores	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
up	N
stairs	N
into	N
the	N
bedroom	N
to	N
grab	N
some	N
clothes	N
.	N
	
After	N
finding	N
on	N
what	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
wear	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
into	N
the	N
bathroom	N
and	N
shut	N
the	N
door	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
bath	N
tub	N
,	N
and	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
faucet	N
.	N
	
I	N
messed	N
around	N
with	N
the	N
knobs	N
on	N
the	N
faucet	N
to	N
get	N
some	N
hot	N
water	N
that	N
was	N
perfect	N
temperature	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
found	C
the	N
perfect	N
temperature	N
I	N
then	N
plug	N
the	N
drain	C
and	N
then	N
put	N
a	N
small	N
amount	N
of	N
bubble	C
bath	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N
	
While	N
I	N
am	N
waiting	N
for	N
the	N
water	N
to	N
raise	N
,	N
I	N
take	N
off	N
my	N
clothes	N
and	N
put	N
them	N
into	N
the	N
laundry	C
basket	N
.	N
	
After	N
the	N
water	N
is	N
at	N
an	N
acceptable	N
level	N
,	N
I	N
turn	N
off	N
the	N
faucet	N
completely	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
turn	N
some	N
music	N
on	N
,	N
and	N
sit	N
down	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
relax	N
for	N
a	N
while	N
.	N
	
I	N
get	N
a	N
washcloth	N
and	N
clean	N
myself	N
up	N
everywhere	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
am	N
done	N
I	N
then	N
get	N
up	N
and	N
dry	N
myself	N
off	N
with	N
a	N
towel	N
and	N
drain	C
the	N
water	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
am	N
dried	N
I	N
put	N
my	N
new	N
clothes	N
on	N
and	N
clean	N
up	N
the	N
bathroom	N
.	N
	
Today	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
bath	N
in	N
my	N
new	N
apartment	N
.	N
	
It	N
is	N
the	N
first	N
time	N
I	N
bathed	N
there	N
so	N
I	N
need	N
to	N
get	N
my	N
things	N
ready	N
.	N
	
First	N
,	N
I	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
filled	N
the	N
bath	N
up	N
with	N
nice	N
warm	N
water	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
that	N
I	N
have	N
my	N
shampoo	N
,	N
soap	N
,	N
and	N
sponge	N
ready	N
to	N
get	N
in	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
have	N
those	N
things	N
,	N
I	N
hang	N
my	N
towel	N
up	N
on	N
the	N
towel	N
rack	N
and	N
sink	N
into	N
the	N
splendid	C
bath	N
.	N
	
I	N
always	N
put	N
some	N
music	N
so	N
I	N
can	N
sing	N
along	N
in	N
the	N
shower	N
.	N
	
I	N
make	N
sure	N
I	N
scrub	N
real	N
good	N
,	N
especially	N
behind	N
my	N
ears	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
get	N
squeaky	C
clean	N
I	N
relax	N
for	N
a	N
little	N
while	N
longer	N
,	N
and	N
get	N
out	N
the	N
shower	N
before	N
I	N
get	N
wrinkly	N
skin	N
.	N
	
Once	N
Im	N
out	N
I	N
shake	N
off	N
the	N
excess	C
water	N
and	N
dry	N
my	N
body	N
real	N
good	N
with	N
the	N
towel	N
,	N
then	N
I	N
dry	N
my	N
hair	N
with	N
the	N
blow	N
dryer	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
nice	N
bath	N
.	N
	
I	N
thought	N
about	N
taking	N
my	N
usual	N
shower	N
today	N
,	N
but	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
instead	N
.	N
	
I	N
have	N
had	N
a	N
stressful	N
week	N
and	N
the	N
relaxation	N
will	N
do	N
me	N
good	N
.	N
	
I	N
get	N
everything	N
ready	N
that	N
I	N
will	N
need-my	N
towel	N
,	N
my	N
bath	N
beads	N
,	N
a	N
book	N
and	N
a	N
candle	N
.	N
	
I	N
run	N
the	N
water	N
just	N
a	N
bit	N
on	N
the	N
warm	N
side	N
since	N
I	N
do	N
n't	N
want	N
the	N
bath	N
getting	N
cold	N
too	N
soon	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
the	N
stopper	N
in	N
on	N
the	N
bath	N
drain	C
and	N
then	N
pour	N
in	N
my	N
bath	N
beads	N
.	N
	
Time	N
to	N
run	N
the	N
water	N
.	N
	
I	N
've	N
lit	N
my	N
candle	N
and	N
grabbed	N
my	N
book	N
.	N
	
I	N
love	N
to	N
soak	C
for	N
a	N
bit	N
,	N
it	N
's	N
so	N
relaxing	N
.	N
	
I	N
will	N
get	N
through	N
a	N
chapter	N
or	N
two	N
of	N
my	N
book	N
,	N
depending	N
how	N
fast	N
I	N
feel	N
like	N
reading	N
.	N
	
The	N
whole	N
atmosphere	N
is	N
de-stressing	N
me	N
.	N
	
After	N
my	N
bath	N
,	N
I	N
will	N
towel	N
off	N
and	N
get	N
into	N
my	N
pajamas	N
.	N
	
I	N
always	N
seem	N
to	N
sleep	N
better	N
after	N
taking	N
a	N
relaxing	N
bath	N
.	N
	
As	N
a	N
child	N
,	N
I	N
loved	N
taking	N
baths	N
.	N
	
My	N
mother	N
always	N
had	N
to	N
fill	N
the	N
tub	N
for	N
me	N
so	N
that	N
the	N
water	N
would	N
not	N
be	N
too	N
hot	N
or	N
too	N
cold	N
.	N
	
I	N
'd	N
say	N
that	N
the	N
ideal	C
temperature	N
for	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
about	N
90	N
degrees	N
.	N
	
My	N
favorite	N
part	N
of	N
taking	N
a	N
bath	N
was	N
the	N
bubbles	N
.	N
	
I	N
loved	N
to	N
splash	C
around	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
play	N
with	N
the	N
bubbles	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
sat	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
,	N
I	N
used	N
shampoo	N
to	N
wash	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
a	N
washed	N
my	N
body	N
with	N
a	N
soapy	N
washcloth	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
to	N
wash	N
behind	N
my	N
ears	N
and	N
on	N
my	N
face	N
as	N
well	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
was	N
clean	N
,	N
I	N
would	N
play	N
with	N
my	N
bath	N
toys	N
for	N
a	N
little	N
while	N
.	N
	
After	N
some	N
time	N
has	N
passed	N
,	N
I	N
drained	N
the	N
water	N
.	N
	
After	N
draining	N
the	N
water	N
,	N
I	N
would	N
stand	N
up	N
and	N
dry	N
myself	N
off	N
with	N
a	N
towel	N
.	N
	
I	N
enjoyed	N
taking	N
baths	N
because	N
I	N
often	N
needed	N
to	N
be	N
cleaned	N
,	N
I	N
loved	N
to	N
play	N
outside	N
as	N
a	N
kid	N
.	N
	
I	N
ride	N
my	N
bike	N
to	N
work	N
everyday	N
.	N
	
I	N
also	N
ride	N
for	N
pleasure	N
on	N
the	N
weekends	N
.	N
	
This	N
morning	N
I	N
was	N
pedaling	N
along	N
and	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
sudden	C
I	N
could	N
feel	N
the	N
gritty	N
pavement	N
scraping	N
the	N
rim	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
off	N
the	N
bike	N
and	N
sure	N
enough	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
was	N
flat	N
.	N
	
Well	N
that	N
is	N
bad	N
but	N
not	N
as	N
bad	N
if	N
the	N
rear	C
tire	C
was	N
flat	N
and	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
chain	N
off	N
.	N
	
I	N
always	N
carry	N
a	N
spare	N
inner	C
tube	N
and	N
have	N
a	N
pump	N
on	N
the	N
frame	N
of	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N
	
This	N
was	N
going	N
to	N
be	N
easy	N
as	N
I	N
have	N
done	N
this	N
many	N
times	C
before	N
.	N
	
I	N
loosened	N
the	N
lock	N
nuts	N
that	N
hold	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
in	N
place	N
and	N
pulled	N
the	N
tire	C
from	N
the	N
frame	N
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
in	N
my	N
bike	N
pack	N
and	N
found	C
the	N
tool	C
that	N
helps	N
take	N
the	N
tire	C
off	N
the	N
rim	N
.	N
	
This	N
took	N
all	N
of	N
5	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
had	N
that	N
off	N
I	N
took	N
the	N
old	N
inner	C
tube	N
and	N
placed	N
it	N
in	N
my	N
backpack	N
to	N
patch	C
later	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
fit	N
the	N
good	N
inner	C
tube	N
inside	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
in	N
reverse	C
order	N
fitted	N
the	N
tire	C
to	N
the	N
rim	N
.	N
	
I	N
next	N
took	N
my	N
pump	N
and	N
filled	N
it	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
correct	N
pressure	C
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
on	N
the	N
front	N
fork	N
and	N
tightened	N
the	N
locking	N
nuts	N
and	N
was	N
on	N
my	N
way	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
n't	N
even	N
late	N
for	N
work	N
.	N
	
The	N
other	N
day	N
,	N
my	N
best	N
friend	N
and	N
I	N
were	N
riding	N
to	N
his	N
house	N
.	N
	
When	N
we	N
were	N
almost	N
there	N
,	N
I	N
noticed	N
that	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
on	N
my	N
bicycle	N
felt	N
rather	N
wobbly	N
and	N
was	N
most	N
likely	N
flat	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
in	N
luck	N
however	N
,	N
as	N
my	N
friend	N
had	N
a	N
bicycle	N
repair	N
kit	N
and	N
some	N
spare	N
tires	N
.	N
	
Once	N
we	N
arrived	N
at	N
my	N
friend	N
's	N
house	N
,	N
I	N
asked	N
my	N
friend	N
if	N
he	N
let	N
me	N
borrow	N
his	N
bicycle	N
repair	N
kit	N
.	N
	
First	N
,	N
I	N
turned	N
the	N
bike	N
over	N
and	N
removed	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
and	N
tube	N
.	N
	
Next	N
I	N
filled	N
the	N
tube	N
with	N
air	N
to	N
check	N
where	N
the	N
tube	N
was	N
damaged	N
,	N
and	N
found	C
a	N
small	N
glass	N
shard	N
which	N
had	N
punctured	N
through	N
it	N
.	N
	
After	N
making	N
ensure	C
the	N
tube	N
was	N
fully	N
deflated	N
,	N
I	N
repaired	N
the	N
puncture	N
in	N
the	N
tube	N
by	N
using	N
glue	C
and	N
applying	N
a	N
patch	C
on	N
top	N
,	N
then	N
slid	N
it	N
back	N
onto	N
the	N
tire	C
using	N
my	N
hands	N
.	N
	
Next	N
,	N
I	N
placed	N
and	N
pushed	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
onto	N
the	N
tube	N
.	N
	
After	N
which	N
,	N
I	N
reconnected	N
the	N
tire	C
onto	N
the	N
bicycle	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
,	N
I	N
pumped	N
air	N
into	N
the	N
tire	C
until	N
it	N
was	N
filled	N
up	N
and	N
the	N
bicycle	N
was	N
ready	N
to	N
be	N
ridden	N
again	N
.	N
	
My	N
bike	N
tire	C
was	N
flat	N
so	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
bike	N
shop	N
and	N
bought	N
a	N
replacement	C
.	N
	
I	N
first	N
took	N
the	N
old	N
tire	C
off	N
of	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
set	N
my	N
bike	N
on	N
a	N
rack	N
to	N
that	N
the	N
flat	N
tire	C
would	N
be	N
easy	N
to	N
get	N
to	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
put	N
the	N
new	N
tire	C
around	N
the	N
wheel	N
to	N
see	N
if	N
it	N
fits	N
.	N
	
It	N
did	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
put	N
the	N
new	N
tire	C
into	N
the	N
grooves	N
inside	N
the	N
wheel	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
walked	N
with	N
my	N
bike	N
to	N
the	N
gas	N
station	N
just	N
around	N
the	N
corner	N
to	N
fill	N
it	N
up	N
with	N
air	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
a	N
quarter	N
into	N
the	N
air	N
machine	N
and	N
put	N
my	N
bike	N
next	N
to	N
the	N
air	N
hose	N
and	N
filled	N
the	N
tire	C
up	N
.	N
	
I	N
checked	N
the	N
air	N
pressure	C
with	N
a	N
gauge	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
alright	N
.	N
	
I	N
felt	N
around	N
the	N
tire	C
to	N
make	N
sure	N
that	N
it	N
was	N
solidly	N
in	N
place	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
.	N
	
While	N
I	N
was	N
out	N
riding	N
my	N
bike	N
one	N
warm	N
spring	N
day	N
,	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
tires	N
went	N
flat	N
.	N
	
Fortunately	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
repair	N
kit	N
with	N
me	N
in	N
a	N
pouch	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
.	N
	
I	N
always	N
kept	N
it	N
with	N
me	N
on	N
rides	N
just	N
in	N
case	N
of	N
such	C
an	N
occurrence	C
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
off	N
and	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
side	N
of	N
the	N
trail	C
out	N
of	N
the	N
way	N
of	N
other	N
bikers	N
and	N
runners	N
.	N
	
I	N
lay	N
the	N
bike	N
on	N
its	N
side	N
and	N
got	N
the	N
repair	N
kit	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
pouch	N
.	N
	
The	N
repair	N
kit	N
contained	N
a	N
new	N
inner	C
tube	N
which	N
I	N
inflated	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
pulled	N
the	N
outer	C
tire	C
off	N
of	N
the	N
inner	C
tube	N
.	N
	
I	N
replaced	N
the	N
flattened	N
inner	C
tube	N
with	N
the	N
new	N
one	N
and	N
replaced	N
the	N
outer	C
tire	C
over	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
rode	N
off	N
slowly	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
everything	N
was	N
correctly	N
in	N
place	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
got	N
home	N
,	N
I	N
replaced	N
the	N
spare	N
tire	C
kit	N
with	N
a	N
new	N
one	N
so	N
that	N
I	N
would	N
be	N
prepared	N
on	N
my	N
next	N
ride	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
going	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
a	N
bike	N
ride	N
with	N
a	N
friend	N
.	N
	
I	N
pulled	N
my	N
bike	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
garage	N
only	N
to	N
discover	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
n't	N
sure	N
if	N
the	N
flat	N
was	N
just	N
from	N
a	N
slow	N
leak	C
or	N
a	N
bad	N
tube	N
.	N
	
If	N
it	N
was	N
from	N
a	N
bad	N
tube	N
I	N
would	N
have	N
to	N
use	N
tools	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
tire	C
completely	N
off	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
would	N
have	N
to	N
replace	N
the	N
tube	N
.	N
	
If	N
it	N
was	N
just	N
a	N
slow	N
leak	C
I	N
could	N
just	N
inflate	N
the	N
tire	C
with	N
my	N
air	N
pump	N
and	N
be	N
on	N
my	N
way	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
try	N
the	N
easy	N
route	N
first	N
and	N
inflated	N
the	N
tire	C
with	N
the	N
pump	N
.	N
	
It	N
felt	N
as	N
if	N
the	N
tire	C
was	N
full	N
and	N
the	N
problem	N
was	N
solved	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
the	N
bike	N
for	N
a	N
test	N
ride	N
around	N
the	N
neighborhood	N
just	N
to	N
be	N
sure	N
that	N
it	N
was	N
fully	N
inflated	N
and	N
would	N
stay	N
that	N
way	N
.	N
	
It	N
stayed	N
inflated	N
and	N
I	N
set	N
off	N
to	N
meet	N
with	N
my	N
friend	N
.	N
	
If	N
you	N
have	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
it	N
is	N
quite	N
easy	N
to	N
change	N
it	N
yourself	N
.	N
	
The	N
front	N
tire	C
is	N
the	N
easiest	N
to	N
change	N
while	N
the	N
back	N
will	N
require	N
more	N
time	N
and	N
maybe	N
additional	C
tools	N
.	N
	
This	N
is	N
usually	N
the	N
back	N
tire	C
is	N
where	N
the	N
chain	N
and	N
gears	N
are	N
connected	N
to	N
so	N
it	N
is	N
harder	N
to	N
take	N
off	N
the	N
bike	N
frame	N
.	N
	
Sadly	C
,	N
most	N
of	N
the	N
time	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
is	N
the	N
back	N
tire	C
because	N
the	N
back	N
tire	C
supports	N
most	N
of	N
your	N
weight	N
on	N
a	N
bicycle	N
.	N
	
So	N
you	N
'll	N
need	N
a	N
wrench	N
to	N
undo	C
the	N
bolts	N
on	N
both	N
sides	N
of	N
the	N
tire	C
.	N
	
This	N
will	N
allow	N
you	N
to	N
take	N
off	N
the	N
entire	C
tire	C
.	N
	
Inside	N
the	N
tire	C
is	N
an	N
innertube	N
,	N
and	N
this	N
is	N
the	N
part	N
you	N
either	N
need	N
to	N
replace	N
or	N
patch	C
up	N
.	N
	
If	N
it	N
is	N
a	N
small	N
hole	N
and	N
you	N
can	N
easily	N
find	N
the	N
hole	N
,	N
you	N
can	N
use	N
a	N
tire	C
patch	C
kit	N
to	N
fix	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
Other	N
wise	C
you	N
may	N
just	N
replace	N
the	N
entire	C
innertube	N
altogether	N
.	N
	
Either	N
way	N
you	N
will	N
put	N
the	N
innertube	N
back	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
onto	N
the	N
bike	N
frame	N
.	N
	
Lastly	C
,	N
screw	N
back	N
on	N
the	N
bolts	N
and	N
pump	N
some	N
air	N
into	N
the	N
tire	C
.	N
	
You	N
'll	N
be	N
ready	N
to	N
ride	N
soon	N
after	N
!	N
One	N
day	N
my	N
bicycle	N
tire	C
got	N
flat	N
due	N
to	N
hitting	N
some	N
glass	N
in	N
the	N
street	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
had	N
to	N
walk	N
the	N
rest	N
of	N
the	N
way	N
home	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
it	N
into	N
my	N
garage	N
and	N
tried	N
to	N
repair	N
it	N
by	N
putting	N
some	N
duct	N
tape	N
on	N
it	N
and	N
pumping	N
it	N
with	N
air	N
.	N
	
This	N
,	N
however	N
,	N
only	N
made	N
matters	N
worst	N
and	N
all	N
the	N
air	N
ended	N
up	N
making	N
another	N
hole	N
in	N
my	N
tire	C
because	N
I	N
over	N
inflated	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
no	N
other	N
options	N
and	N
I	N
ordered	N
a	N
new	N
tire	C
on	N
Amazon	N
for	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N
	
Once	N
that	N
came	N
in	N
the	N
mail	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
to	N
repair	N
my	N
broken	N
bike	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
a	N
socket	N
wrench	N
and	N
unscrewed	N
the	N
nut	C
of	N
the	N
bike	N
that	N
attached	N
to	N
the	N
wheel	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
I	N
got	N
my	N
new	N
bike	N
tire	C
and	N
put	N
it	N
on	N
the	N
frame	N
of	N
the	N
bike	N
and	N
screwed	N
it	N
back	N
on	N
.	N
	
Once	N
that	N
was	N
complete	N
my	N
bike	N
was	N
as	N
good	N
as	N
new	N
and	N
I	N
was	N
back	N
to	N
riding	N
my	N
daily	N
bike	N
trail	C
by	N
my	N
house	N
.	N
	
my	N
sister	N
Jane	N
and	N
I	N
love	N
to	N
go	N
bicycling	N
.	N
	
One	N
warm	N
day	N
in	N
June	N
,	N
we	N
wanted	N
to	N
go	N
out	N
and	N
ride	N
but	N
my	N
bike	N
had	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
.	N
	
I	N
carefully	N
took	N
the	N
tire	C
off	N
of	N
the	N
rim	N
and	N
then	N
inflated	N
it	N
with	N
a	N
hand	N
pump	N
so	N
I	N
could	N
find	N
the	N
leak	C
.	N
	
A	N
blast	N
of	N
cool	N
air	N
on	N
my	N
fingers	N
led	N
me	N
to	N
the	N
problem	N
:	N
a	N
single	N
round	N
hole	N
,	N
probably	N
caused	N
by	N
a	N
nail	C
or	N
other	N
sharp	N
object	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
out	N
my	N
patch	C
kit	N
,	N
and	N
Jane	N
held	N
up	N
the	N
tire	C
for	N
me	N
as	N
I	N
first	N
applied	N
glue	C
and	N
then	N
placed	N
a	N
patch	C
carefully	N
over	N
the	N
damaged	N
area	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
to	N
let	N
it	N
dry	N
,	N
so	N
we	N
took	N
turns	N
riding	N
Jane	N
's	N
bike	N
for	N
a	N
while	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
inflated	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
checked	N
the	N
patch	C
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
good	N
!	N
The	N
leak	C
was	N
repaired	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
on	N
my	N
bike	N
and	N
we	N
went	N
off	N
on	N
a	N
nice	N
long	N
ride	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
happy	N
to	N
have	N
my	N
bike	N
fixed	C
again	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
about	N
to	N
go	N
for	N
a	N
bicycle	N
ride	N
,	N
but	N
when	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
garage	N
to	N
get	N
my	N
bike	N
I	N
realized	N
the	N
tire	C
was	N
completely	N
flat	N
.	N
	
Luckily	N
I	N
was	N
prepared	N
for	N
just	N
such	C
an	N
event	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
a	N
shelf	N
and	N
found	C
my	N
bicycle	N
repair	N
kit	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
close	N
look	N
at	N
the	N
bicycle	N
tire	C
.	N
	
If	N
I	N
could	N
n't	N
find	N
the	N
leak	C
,	N
I	N
could	N
always	N
fill	N
a	N
tub	N
with	N
water	N
,	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
under	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
see	N
where	N
the	N
bubbles	N
come	N
out	N
.	N
	
Luckily	N
the	N
leak	C
was	N
obvious	N
.	N
	
I	N
applied	N
some	N
adhesive	N
from	N
the	N
kit	N
and	N
put	N
on	N
a	N
rubber	N
patch	C
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
got	N
down	N
my	N
bicycle	N
pump	N
.	N
	
I	N
hooked	N
the	N
hose	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
nipple	N
on	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
then	N
pumped	N
up	N
and	N
down	N
vigorously	N
for	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
I	N
felt	N
the	N
tire	C
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
nice	N
and	N
firm	N
.	N
	
Success	N
!	N
I	N
put	N
away	N
the	N
pump	N
and	N
kit	N
and	N
hopped	N
on	N
for	N
my	N
bike	N
ride	N
.	N
	
Once	N
,	N
when	N
I	N
was	N
12	N
,	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
flat	N
bicycle	N
tire	C
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
ridden	N
over	N
a	N
nail	C
and	N
my	N
tire	C
was	N
punctured	N
and	N
my	N
tube	N
popped	N
.	N
	
In	N
order	N
to	N
fix	N
it	N
my	N
brother	N
took	N
me	N
the	N
store	N
so	N
I	N
could	N
buy	N
a	N
patch	C
to	N
fix	N
the	N
tire	C
.	N
	
Once	N
we	N
got	N
the	N
patch	C
,	N
we	N
went	N
back	N
to	N
the	N
house	N
.	N
	
In	N
order	N
to	N
find	N
the	N
hole	N
we	N
filled	N
the	N
tub	N
with	N
water	N
and	N
put	N
the	N
tube	N
in	N
.	N
	
We	N
looked	N
to	N
see	N
where	N
bubbles	N
came	N
out	N
;	N
where	N
the	N
bubbles	N
came	N
out	N
told	N
us	N
where	N
the	N
hole	N
was	N
.	N
	
Once	N
we	N
noted	N
the	N
location	N
of	N
the	N
hole	N
we	N
took	N
the	N
tube	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
dried	N
it	N
.	N
	
To	N
put	N
on	N
the	N
patch	C
we	N
had	N
to	N
put	N
a	N
glue	C
on	N
the	N
tube	N
and	N
then	N
put	N
on	N
the	N
patch	C
.	N
	
We	N
held	N
it	N
there	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
it	N
would	N
stay	N
,	N
then	N
we	N
let	N
it	N
sit	N
for	N
an	N
hour	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
the	N
glue	C
would	N
dry	N
.	N
	
To	N
make	N
sure	N
it	N
dried	N
well	N
we	N
placed	N
the	N
tube	N
out	N
in	N
the	N
sun	N
so	N
the	N
the	N
heat	N
could	N
help	N
it	N
along	N
.	N
	
To	N
be	N
safe	N
we	N
waited	N
a	N
day	N
.	N
	
The	N
next	N
day	N
we	N
took	N
the	N
tube	N
and	N
put	N
it	N
back	N
in	N
the	N
tire	C
,	N
then	N
we	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
on	N
the	N
wheel	N
.	N
	
My	N
bike	N
was	N
good	N
to	N
ride	N
again	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
riding	N
in	N
the	N
bike	N
lane	C
going	N
to	N
work	N
when	N
I	N
felt	N
my	N
tire	C
pop	N
and	N
give	N
out	N
on	N
me	N
.	N
	
I	N
quickly	N
pulled	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
side	N
walk	N
and	N
got	N
off	N
my	N
bike	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
good	N
look	N
at	N
it	N
.	N
	
A	N
rock	N
was	N
embedded	N
into	N
my	N
tire	C
tube	N
.	N
	
I	N
pried	N
the	N
rock	N
out	N
with	N
my	N
fingers	N
and	N
got	N
my	N
patch	C
kit	N
from	N
my	N
backpack	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
there	N
was	N
no	N
other	N
debris	N
in	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
then	N
applied	N
the	N
glue	C
.	N
	
I	N
stuck	C
the	N
patch	C
onto	N
the	N
glue	C
and	N
made	N
sure	N
it	N
was	N
a	N
nice	N
fit	N
and	N
held	N
well	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
i	N
pumped	N
my	N
tire	C
back	N
up	N
with	N
air	N
and	N
checked	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
it	N
would	N
hold	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
rigors	N
of	N
the	N
road	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
I	N
hopped	N
back	N
on	N
my	N
bike	N
and	N
slowly	N
rode	N
to	N
work	N
careful	N
of	N
anymore	N
rocks	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
to	N
work	N
on	N
time	N
.	N
	
This	N
is	N
why	N
i	N
always	N
carry	N
around	N
my	N
repair	N
kit	N
.	N
	
The	N
other	N
day	N
my	N
dad	N
was	N
riding	N
his	N
bike	N
and	N
started	N
having	N
trouble	N
steering	N
.	N
	
He	N
rode	N
the	N
bike	N
back	N
home	N
and	N
then	N
took	N
it	N
into	N
the	N
back	N
yard	N
to	N
have	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
it	N
.	N
	
He	N
noticed	N
that	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
was	N
flat	N
and	N
was	N
n't	N
keeping	N
air	N
in	N
it	N
.	N
	
He	N
took	N
it	N
off	N
the	N
bike	N
.	N
	
First	N
he	N
pumped	N
it	N
up	N
and	N
tried	N
to	N
see	N
if	N
the	N
tire	C
would	N
hold	N
air	N
.	N
	
It	N
would	N
not	N
.	N
	
Then	N
he	N
rubbed	N
liquid	N
dish	N
detergent	N
on	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
pumped	N
it	N
up	N
and	N
looked	N
for	N
where	N
it	N
bubbled	N
to	N
see	N
where	N
the	N
hole	N
was	N
.	N
	
Once	N
he	N
found	C
the	N
hole	N
,	N
he	N
decided	N
if	N
it	N
needed	N
a	N
patch	C
or	N
a	N
plug	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
small	N
round	N
hole	N
so	N
he	N
decided	N
to	N
put	N
a	N
plug	N
in	N
it	N
.	N
	
He	N
got	N
the	N
packages	N
of	N
plugs	N
and	N
found	C
one	N
that	N
was	N
the	N
right	N
size	N
.	N
	
He	N
followed	N
the	N
instructs	N
on	N
the	N
package	C
to	N
insert	C
the	N
plug	N
into	N
the	N
hole	N
and	N
secure	C
it	N
.	N
	
He	N
pumped	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
up	N
and	N
it	N
held	N
air	N
.	N
	
He	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
.	N
	
My	N
husband	N
was	N
riding	N
down	N
a	N
steep	N
hill	N
a	N
few	N
miles	C
from	N
home	N
when	N
he	N
got	N
a	N
blow	N
out	N
.	N
	
He	N
called	N
me	N
to	N
come	N
and	N
get	N
him	N
.	N
	
Luckily	N
he	N
was	N
n't	N
hurt	N
.	N
	
He	N
had	N
the	N
bicycle	N
repair	N
kit	N
on	N
him	N
.	N
	
We	N
took	N
the	N
tire	C
off	N
with	N
some	N
tools	N
.	N
	
We	N
took	N
the	N
inner	C
tube	N
out	N
.	N
	
He	N
checked	N
the	N
inner	C
tube	N
for	N
holes	N
by	N
putting	N
air	N
in	N
it	N
.	N
	
He	N
found	C
the	N
hole	N
and	N
marked	N
it	N
.	N
	
That	N
is	N
the	N
place	N
where	N
he	N
put	N
the	N
patch	C
and	N
glued	N
it	N
.	N
	
My	N
husband	N
put	N
the	N
tube	N
back	N
in	N
the	N
bicycle	N
.	N
	
The	N
frame	N
was	N
a	N
little	N
bent	N
but	N
the	N
bike	N
was	N
okay	N
.	N
	
I	N
followed	N
him	N
for	N
a	N
little	N
while	N
.	N
	
He	N
was	N
almost	N
to	N
the	N
park	N
so	N
I	N
met	N
him	N
there	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
while	N
we	N
put	N
the	N
bike	N
in	N
the	N
back	N
of	N
the	N
truck	N
and	N
drove	N
home	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
out	N
to	N
my	N
garage	N
to	N
get	N
my	N
bike	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
a	N
ride	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
saw	N
my	N
bike	N
I	N
realized	N
that	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
tires	N
were	N
flat	N
.	N
	
I	N
needed	N
to	N
buy	N
a	N
new	N
tube	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
fix	N
the	N
flat	N
.	N
	
I	N
drove	N
to	N
the	N
local	N
bike	N
shop	N
and	N
purchased	N
a	N
tube	N
that	N
would	N
fit	N
my	N
bike	N
's	N
tire	C
and	N
then	N
I	N
drove	N
back	N
home	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
the	N
tube	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
packaging	N
and	N
read	N
the	N
instructions	N
on	N
how	N
to	N
put	N
it	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
.	N
	
I	N
removed	N
the	N
tire	C
from	N
the	N
bike	N
and	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
old	N
tube	N
that	N
was	N
punctured	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
inserted	N
the	N
new	N
tube	N
onto	N
the	N
tire	C
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
and	N
pumped	N
up	N
the	N
tube	N
with	N
air	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
filled	N
to	N
the	N
desired	N
fill	N
weight	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
to	N
test	N
it	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
in	N
great	N
shape	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
took	N
off	N
on	N
my	N
bike	N
ride	N
.	N
	
Yesterday	N
,	N
my	N
bike	N
tire	C
popped	N
while	N
I	N
was	N
riding	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
to	N
walk	N
45	N
min	N
home	N
to	N
get	N
it	N
fixed	C
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
tried	N
riding	N
it	N
with	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
,	N
but	N
the	N
bike	N
dragged	N
on	N
the	N
cement	N
and	N
I	N
did	N
n't	N
have	N
the	N
man	N
power	N
to	N
turn	N
the	N
wheels	N
.	N
	
When	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
home	N
I	N
asked	N
my	N
father	N
for	N
help	N
.	N
	
We	N
inflated	N
the	N
tire	C
a	N
little	N
with	N
a	N
mechanical	C
pump	N
.	N
	
You	N
grab	N
the	N
pump	N
with	N
two	N
hands	N
,	N
pull	N
the	N
lever	N
up	N
and	N
then	N
push	N
down	N
with	N
your	N
whole	N
body	N
weight	N
.	N
	
We	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
underwater	C
to	N
find	N
where	N
bubbles	N
were	N
coming	N
out	N
to	N
find	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
After	N
we	N
found	C
the	N
hole	N
,	N
we	N
dried	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
sprayed	N
a	N
rubber	N
sealant	N
to	N
the	N
tire	C
to	N
seal	C
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
Afterwards	N
,	N
we	N
inflated	N
the	N
tire	C
.	N
	
Then	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
on	N
it	N
to	N
see	N
if	N
it	N
worked	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
day	N
or	N
so	N
,	N
I	N
rode	N
it	N
again	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
the	N
tire	C
was	N
n't	N
deflating	N
.	N
	
Yesterday	N
,	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
ride	N
my	N
bike	N
because	N
the	N
weather	N
was	N
so	N
nice	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
my	N
bike	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
storage	C
closet	N
and	N
noticed	N
it	N
had	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
.	N
	
Since	N
I	N
do	N
not	N
have	N
a	N
spare	N
tire	C
,	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
fix	N
it	N
if	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
ride	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
my	N
bike	N
pump	N
and	N
patch	C
kit	N
.	N
	
I	N
pumped	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
locate	C
the	N
air	N
leak	C
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
patch	C
and	N
applied	N
it	N
to	N
the	N
part	N
of	N
the	N
tire	C
that	N
had	N
the	N
little	N
leak	C
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
pumped	N
the	N
tire	C
again	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
to	N
be	N
careful	N
not	N
to	N
overfill	N
the	N
tire	C
so	N
the	N
patch	C
would	N
n't	N
pop	N
off	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
was	N
sure	N
the	N
patch	C
would	N
n't	N
come	N
off	N
,	N
I	N
made	N
sure	N
that	N
I	N
pumped	N
the	N
air	N
into	N
the	N
tire	C
sufficiently	C
.	N
	
I	N
tested	N
the	N
tire	C
by	N
sitting	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
and	N
riding	N
around	N
a	N
little	N
.	N
	
The	N
tire	C
seemed	N
to	N
hold	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
was	N
ready	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
my	N
bike	N
ride	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
such	C
a	N
nice	N
day	N
and	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
great	N
day	N
riding	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N
	
Yesterday	N
while	N
I	N
was	N
riding	N
my	N
bike	N
I	N
got	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
.	N
	
Luckily	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
tire	C
repair	N
kit	N
in	N
the	N
garage	N
.	N
	
It	N
's	N
very	N
easy	N
to	N
do	N
.	N
	
The	N
first	N
thing	N
I	N
did	N
was	N
use	N
a	N
flathead	N
screwdriver	N
to	N
pop	N
the	N
tire	C
off	N
of	N
the	N
rim	N
.	N
	
The	N
tire	C
is	N
hollow	C
inside	N
,	N
with	N
no	N
tube	N
.	N
	
The	N
patch	C
kit	N
contains	N
small	N
rubber	N
patches	N
with	N
glue	C
,	N
that	N
you	N
use	N
to	N
seal	C
up	N
any	N
holes	N
that	N
might	N
appear	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
had	N
the	N
tire	C
off	N
the	N
rim	N
I	N
looked	N
all	N
around	N
inside	N
to	N
find	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
found	C
it	N
,	N
I	N
used	N
a	N
special	N
piece	N
of	N
sandpaper	N
inside	N
the	N
repair	N
kit	N
to	N
clean	N
off	N
the	N
area	N
around	N
the	N
hole	N
,	N
so	N
the	N
glue	C
would	N
stick	N
nicely	C
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
applied	N
the	N
glue	C
and	N
put	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
small	N
rubber	N
patches	N
onto	N
it	N
.	N
	
The	N
instructions	N
said	N
to	N
let	N
it	N
dry	N
for	N
a	N
few	N
hours	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
went	N
inside	N
and	N
watched	N
TV	N
.	N
	
After	N
awhile	N
I	N
came	N
back	N
out	N
and	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
on	N
the	N
rim	N
,	N
then	N
used	N
a	N
pump	N
to	N
pump	N
the	N
tire	C
full	N
of	N
air	N
.	N
	
Sure	N
enough	N
,	N
it	N
fixed	C
the	N
hole	N
!	N
Riding	N
my	N
bike	N
through	N
the	N
park	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
enjoying	N
the	N
beautiful	N
spring	N
scenery	N
.	N
	
A	N
family	N
of	N
squirrels	N
caught	N
my	N
attention	N
and	N
I	N
was	N
looking	N
at	N
them	N
when	N
I	N
hit	N
some	N
broken	N
glass	N
.	N
	
My	N
bike	N
's	N
tire	C
immediately	N
deflated	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
it	N
back	N
to	N
my	N
car	N
,	N
loaded	N
up	N
,	N
and	N
headed	N
for	N
a	N
local	N
department	N
store	N
.	N
	
Sure	N
enough	N
,	N
they	N
had	N
bike	N
tire	C
repair	N
kits	N
in	N
the	N
sporting	N
goods	N
section	N
.	N
	
I	N
bought	N
one	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
headed	N
on	N
home	N
.	N
	
Once	N
there	N
I	N
removed	N
a	N
wheel	N
from	N
the	N
bike	N
.	N
	
From	N
it	N
I	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
inner	C
tube	N
.	N
	
I	N
rubbed	N
some	N
soapy	N
water	N
on	N
it	N
and	N
quickly	N
found	C
the	N
problem	N
spot	N
.	N
	
From	N
my	N
new	N
repair	N
kit	N
I	N
found	C
a	N
special	N
patch	C
.	N
	
I	N
applied	N
the	N
sealant	N
and	N
then	N
stuck	C
the	N
patch	C
on	N
.	N
	
I	N
used	N
a	N
hair	N
dryer	N
to	N
heat	N
and	N
set	N
it	N
.	N
	
Next	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
air	N
compressor	N
and	N
reinflated	N
the	N
inner	C
tube	N
.	N
	
After	N
reassembling	N
everything	N
,	N
I	N
sat	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
and	N
tested	N
it	N
out	N
.	N
	
Good	N
as	N
new	N
!	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
go	N
for	N
a	N
bike	N
ride	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
went	N
out	N
to	N
the	N
garage	N
to	N
get	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N
	
I	N
brought	N
it	N
out	N
to	N
the	N
driveway	N
and	N
got	N
on	N
.	N
	
I	N
noticed	N
that	N
something	N
did	N
n't	N
feel	N
right	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
too	N
hard	N
to	N
pedal	C
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
down	N
and	N
noticed	N
that	N
my	N
front	N
tire	C
was	N
flat	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
back	N
into	N
the	N
garage	N
and	N
brought	N
out	N
my	N
bicycle	N
pump	N
.	N
	
I	N
removed	N
the	N
cover	N
from	N
the	N
air	N
valve	N
and	N
attached	N
the	N
pump	N
to	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
pumped	N
up	N
and	N
down	N
on	N
the	N
handle	N
a	N
few	N
times	C
and	N
noticed	N
that	N
the	N
air	N
was	N
not	N
staying	N
in	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
back	N
into	N
the	N
garage	N
,	N
again	N
,	N
and	N
this	N
time	N
I	N
brought	N
out	N
my	N
bicycle	N
repair	N
kit	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
the	N
hole	N
in	N
my	N
tire	C
,	N
put	N
a	N
patch	C
on	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
filled	N
the	N
tire	C
with	N
air	N
.	N
	
The	N
patch	C
seemed	N
to	N
be	N
nice	N
and	N
sturdy	N
and	N
I	N
believed	N
it	N
was	N
going	N
to	N
hold	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
the	N
air	N
pump	N
and	N
the	N
bicycle	N
tire	C
patch	C
kit	N
back	N
into	N
the	N
garage	N
,	N
put	N
on	N
my	N
helmet	C
,	N
and	N
rode	N
my	N
bicycle	N
down	N
the	N
street	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
riding	N
my	N
bike	N
yesterday	N
and	N
somehow	N
I	N
must	N
have	N
run	N
over	N
something	N
and	N
punctured	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
of	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N
	
I	N
measured	N
my	N
tire	C
height	N
and	N
wrote	N
down	N
my	N
model	N
of	N
my	N
bike	N
before	N
I	N
wen	N
to	N
the	N
bike	N
shop	N
to	N
buy	N
a	N
new	N
inner	C
tube	N
.	N
	
I	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
bike	N
shop	N
and	N
the	N
man	N
behind	N
the	N
counter	C
asked	N
what	N
I	N
needed	N
help	N
with	N
.	N
	
I	N
explained	N
I	N
needed	N
a	N
new	N
inner	C
tube	N
for	N
my	N
bike	N
since	N
I	N
had	N
gotten	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
.	N
	
I	N
showed	N
him	N
the	N
model	N
number	N
and	N
the	N
tire	C
height	N
an	N
d	N
he	N
quickly	N
went	N
a	N
got	N
the	N
inner	C
tube	N
I	N
needed	N
.	N
	
I	N
payed	N
for	N
my	N
purchase	C
,	N
thank	N
the	N
man	N
and	N
went	N
home	N
to	N
fix	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
off	N
and	N
gently	C
pried	N
the	N
outer	C
tire	C
off	N
.	N
	
The	N
inner	C
tube	N
is	N
sort	N
of	N
pliable	N
so	N
I	N
stretched	N
it	N
over	N
and	N
off	N
of	N
the	N
rim	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
the	N
new	N
inner	C
tube	N
and	N
stretched	N
it	N
on	N
the	N
metal	N
rim	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
the	N
stem	N
when	N
you	N
inflate	N
the	N
tire	C
was	N
lined	N
up	N
with	N
the	N
hole	N
on	N
the	N
metal	N
rim	N
.	N
	
I	N
replaced	N
the	N
outer	C
tire	C
and	N
re-inflated	N
the	N
tire	C
with	N
my	N
bicycle	N
pump	N
.	N
	
Now	N
I	N
can	N
ride	N
my	N
bike	N
again	N
!	N
''	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
go	N
shopping	N
downtown	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
public	N
bus	N

I	N
waited	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
where	N
other	N
people	N
were	N
also	N
waiting	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
came	N
right	N
on	N
time	N
and	N
pulled	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
curb	C
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
people	N
getting	N
off	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
step	N
down	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
waited	N
in	N
line	N
as	N
each	N
person	N
got	N
on	N
.	N
	
When	N
it	N
was	N
my	N
turn	N
I	N
stepped	N
up	N
the	N
few	N
steps	N
into	N
front	N
of	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
I	N
swiped	N
my	N
bus	N
card	N
to	N
pay	N
,	N
smiled	N
at	N
the	N
driver	N
,	N
and	N
chose	N
a	N
seat	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
was	N
a	N
little	N
crowded	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
stood	N
and	N
held	N
onto	N
the	N
bar	N
.	N
	
An	N
elderly	N
woman	N
got	N
on	N
the	N
bus	N
next	N
,	N
and	N
a	N
younger	N
person	N
got	N
up	N
to	N
give	N
her	N
his	N
seat	N
.	N
	
When	N
everyone	N
was	N
on	N
,	N
the	N
bus	N
put	N
on	N
his	N
turn	N
signal	C
and	N
pulled	N
back	N
into	N
the	N
street	N
.	N
	
As	N
I	N
got	N
closer	N
to	N
my	N
stop	N
,	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
cord	N
.	N
	
The	N
cord	N
dinged	N
to	N
signal	C
that	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
get	N
off	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
pulled	N
into	N
the	N
stop	N
where	N
other	N
people	N
were	N
waiting	N
to	N
get	N
on	N
.	N
	
They	N
waited	N
until	N
I	N
got	N
off	N
before	N
boarding	N
.	N
	
Last	N
Saturday	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
visit	N
a	N
friend	N
in	N
the	N
hospital	N
.	N
	
I	N
own	N
a	N
car	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
's	N
been	N
acting	N
up	N
lately	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
I	N
set	N
out	N
from	N
my	N
apartment	N
with	N
a	N
spring	N
in	N
my	N
step	N
,	N
because	N
it	N
was	N
an	N
amazing	N
day	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
through	N
my	N
apartment	N
complex	C
's	N
parking	N
lot	N
to	N
reach	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
,	N
where	N
I	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
around	N
5	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
When	N
it	N
came	N
to	N
a	N
stop	N
in	N
front	N
of	N
me	N
,	N
I	N
boarded	N
and	N
put	N
a	N
$	N
1	N
bill	N
and	N
2	N
quarters	N
in	N
the	N
fare	N
machine	N
.	N
	
I	N
selected	N
a	N
seat	N
near	N
the	N
entrance	N
,	N
because	N
it	N
has	N
more	N
space	N
and	N
fewer	N
people	N
.	N
	
Riding	N
the	N
bus	N
often	N
gives	N
me	N
motion	C
sickness	C
,	N
so	N
I	N
closed	N
my	N
eyes	N
and	N
tried	N
to	N
ignore	C
the	N
swaying	N
motion	C
as	N
it	N
rolled	N
down	N
the	N
street	N
.	N
	
Behind	N
me	N
,	N
two	N
college	N
students	N
were	N
eagerly	C
discussing	N
a	N
class	N
project	N
.	N
	
In	N
the	N
very	N
back	N
,	N
a	N
small	N
child	N
was	N
loudly	N
pretending	N
to	N
be	N
a	N
dinosaur	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
glad	N
when	N
I	N
finally	N
reached	N
my	N
destination	N
.	N
	
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
cord	N
signaling	N
that	N
I	N
would	N
need	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
stop	N
next	N
to	N
the	N
hospital	N
,	N
and	N
got	N
up	N
to	N
exit	N
out	N
the	N
bus	N
's	N
side	N
door	N
.	N
	
Fresh	N
air	N
never	N
smelled	N
so	N
good	N
!	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
get	N
to	N
the	N
craft	C
store	N
,	N
there	N
was	N
a	N
sale	C
!	N
Unfortunately	N
,	N
husband	N
had	N
the	N
car	N
and	N
he	N
would	N
be	N
gone	N
a	N
while	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
couple	N
dollars	N
for	N
the	N
fare	N
and	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
about	N
ten	N
minutes	N
,	N
then	N
the	N
bus	N
came	N
around	N
the	N
corner	N
and	N
stopped	N
at	N
the	N
bench	C
I	N
was	N
sitting	N
.	N
	
A	N
few	N
people	N
got	N
off	N
the	N
bus	N
and	N
I	N
stepped	N
through	N
the	N
doors	N
onto	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
I	N
smiled	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
and	N
put	N
the	N
money	N
into	N
the	N
machine	N
to	N
pay	N
for	N
my	N
ride	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
a	N
seat	N
at	N
an	N
open	N
place	N
and	N
looked	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
.	N
	
The	N
store	N
I	N
was	N
going	N
to	N
was	N
only	N
a	N
few	N
stops	N
away	N
and	N
when	N
I	N
saw	N
we	N
were	N
close	N
,	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
cord	N
to	N
signal	C
to	N
the	N
driver	N
I	N
was	N
ready	N
to	N
get	N
off	N
.	N
	
He	N
stopped	N
at	N
the	N
shopping	N
center	N
and	N
I	N
thanked	N
him	N
for	N
the	N
ride	N
as	N
I	N
stepped	N
onto	N
the	N
pavement	N
.	N
	
Yesterday	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
with	N
a	N
few	N
others	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
arrived	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
got	N
on	N
,	N
I	N
scanned	N
my	N
bus	N
pass	N
on	N
the	N
bus	N
pass	N
scanner	N
and	N
then	N
took	N
my	N
seat	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
was	N
not	N
crowded	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
take	N
a	N
seat	N
near	N
the	N
front	N
.	N
	
I	N
sat	N
quietly	N
,	N
playing	N
with	N
my	N
cellphone	N
.	N
	
Others	N
stared	N
around	N
or	N
talked	N
quietly	N
amongst	C
themselves	N
.	N
	
A	N
bell	N
rang	N
every	N
few	N
blocks	N
to	N
indicate	C
someone	N
wanting	N
to	N
get	N
off	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
would	N
stop	N
,	N
let	N
people	N
off	N
,	N
and	N
let	N
new	N
people	N
on	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
started	N
to	N
get	N
crowded	N
so	N
I	N
offered	N
my	N
seat	N
to	N
an	N
older	N
woman	N
.	N
	
She	N
thanked	N
me	N
for	N
the	N
polite	N
etiquette	N
.	N
	
I	N
saw	N
my	N
stop	N
coming	N
up	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
lever	N
and	N
the	N
bell	N
rang	N
again	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
stopped	N
a	N
few	N
moments	N
later	N
.	N
	
I	N
thanked	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
for	N
his	N
services	N
and	N
exited	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
Today	N
,	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
ride	N
the	N
bus	N
home	N
from	N
the	N
market	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
to	N
wait	N
for	N
the	N
next	N
bus	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
supposed	N
to	N
arrive	N
in	N
10	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
bus	N
pulled	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
where	N
I	N
was	N
waiting	N
,	N
I	N
stood	N
up	N
and	N
walked	N
over	N
to	N
curb	C
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
driver	N
opened	N
the	N
bus	N
doors	N
and	N
I	N
stepped	N
up	N
into	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
to	N
hand	N
my	N
money	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
so	N
that	N
I	N
could	N
ride	N
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
driver	N
took	N
my	N
money	N
,	N
I	N
walked	N
down	N
the	N
aisle	N
to	N
find	N
a	N
seat	N
.	N
	
There	N
were	N
many	N
seats	N
available	N
so	N
I	N
picked	N
one	N
beside	N
an	N
older	N
lady	N
that	N
looked	N
like	N
my	N
grandmother	N
.	N
	
She	N
was	N
very	N
nice	N
and	N
talked	N
to	N
me	N
while	N
we	N
rode	N
down	N
the	N
street	N
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
bus	N
stopped	N
down	N
the	N
street	N
from	N
my	N
house	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
off	N
and	N
walked	N
down	N
the	N
sidewalk	N
to	N
my	N
house	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
very	N
glad	N
to	N
be	N
home	N
.	N
	
I	N
love	N
to	N
ride	N
the	N
bus	N
in	N
my	N
town	N
.	N
	
The	N
fare	N
is	N
only	N
75	N
cents	N
.	N
	
It	N
will	N
take	N
you	N
anywhere	N
.	N
	
On	N
Saturdays	N
I	N
get	N
up	N
early	N
and	N
walk	N
down	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
.	N
	
I	N
wait	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
come	N
at	N
8:15	N
.	N
	
I	N
climb	N
up	N
the	N
stairs	N
and	N
drop	N
my	N
fare	N
into	N
the	N
collection	N
box	N
and	N
say	N
hello	N
to	N
the	N
driver	N
.	N
	
Before	N
the	N
bus	N
starts	N
up	N
again	N
I	N
move	N
all	N
the	N
way	N
to	N
the	N
back	N
to	N
sit	N
in	N
the	N
last	N
row	N
of	N
seats	N
.	N
	
Lots	N
of	N

Some	N
with	N
shopping	N
bags	N

others	N
all	N
dressed	N
up	N
and	N
some	N
like	N
me	N
dressed	N
casual	N
for	N
a	N

I	N

until	N
it	N
gets	N
to	N
the	N
center	N
of	N

Before	N

get	N
off	N
I	N
get	N
a	N
transfer	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
And	N
then	N
the	N
fun	N
begins	N
.	N
	
I	N
look	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
route	N
map	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
and	N
look	N
for	N
a	N

.	N
	
This	N
morning	N
I	N
rode	N
a	N
public	N
bus	N
to	N
college	N
.	N
	
Before	N
I	N
left	N
my	N
house	N
,	N
I	N
checked	N
the	N
bus	N
schedule	C
so	N
I	N
would	N
know	N
what	N
time	N
the	N
bus	N
was	N
meant	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
left	N
my	N
house	N
and	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
right	N
outside	N
my	N
house	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
sat	N
on	N
the	N
bench	C
next	N
to	N
an	N
old	N
man	N
and	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N
	
While	N
I	N
waited	N
,	N
I	N
chatted	N
with	N
the	N
old	N
man	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
bus	N
arrived	N
,	N
I	N
let	N
the	N
old	N
man	N
get	N
on	N
in	N
front	N
of	N
me	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
climbed	N
on	N
board	N
the	N
bus	N
,	N
paid	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
the	N
bus	N
fare	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
said	N
``	N
``	N
Good	N
morning	N
``	N
``	N
as	N
he	N
handed	N
me	N
my	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
Holding	N
onto	N
my	N
ticket	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
seat	N
near	N
the	N
front	N
of	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
I	N
stared	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
throughout	C
the	N
bus	N
journey	N
,	N
just	N
enjoying	N
the	N
view	N
.	N
	
When	N
my	N
stop	N
was	N
coming	N
up	N
,	N
I	N
pressed	N
the	N
button	N
to	N
let	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
know	N
to	N
stop	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
He	N
stopped	N
at	N
my	N
stop	N
and	N
I	N
stood	N
up	N
and	N
got	N
off	N
the	N
bus	N
,	N
thanking	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
before	N
I	N
exited	N
.	N
	
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
San	N
Francisco	N
from	N
my	N
home	N
in	N
San	N
Jose	N
and	N
I	N
did	N
n't	N
feel	N
like	N
driving	N
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
online	N
and	N
found	C
a	N
bus	N
route	N
from	N
here	N
to	N
there	N
that	N
was	N
leaving	N
in	N
just	N
about	N
30	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
out	N
of	N
my	N
house	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
and	N
got	N
on	N
it	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
very	N
empty	N
bus	N
and	N
I	N
stared	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
window	N
at	N
the	N
scenery	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
driver	N
was	N
very	N
nice	N
and	N
asked	N
me	N
how	N
my	N
day	N
was	N
.	N
	
We	N
spoke	N
for	N
the	N
whole	N
entire	C
ride	N
and	N
after	N
a	N
short	N
time	N
,	N
we	N
arrived	N
into	N
San	N
Francisco	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
very	N
pleasant	N
not	N
having	N
to	N
drive	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
a	N
very	N
smooth	N
ride	N
on	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
Luckily	N
,	N
there	N
was	N
n't	N
much	N
traffic	N
so	N
we	N
got	N
there	N
in	N
a	N
very	N
short	N
time	N
frame	N
.	N
	
After	N
getting	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
,	N
the	N
driver	N
opened	N
his	N
doors	N
for	N
me	N
and	N
wished	N
me	N
a	N
great	N
day	N
.	N
	
I	N
did	N
the	N
same	N
and	N
stepped	N
off	N
of	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
it	N
was	N
a	N
very	N
easy	N
and	N
fun	N
experience	N
.	N
	
Yesterday	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
the	N
zoo	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
and	N
sat	N
down	N
on	N
the	N
bench	C
while	N
I	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N
	
There	N
was	N
a	N
map	N
of	N
all	N
the	N
bus	N
routes	N
at	N
the	N
stop	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
looked	N
on	N
there	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
I	N
knew	N
which	N
bus	N
would	N
take	N
me	N
to	N
the	N
zoo	N
.	N
	
I	N
saw	N
I	N
needed	N
bus	N
number	N
12	N
.	N
	
Sure	N
enough	N
,	N
there	N
came	N
number	N
12	N
.	N
	
As	N
the	N
bus	N
pulled	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
stop	N
,	N
the	N
driver	N
opened	N
the	N
door	N
to	N
let	N
passengers	N
off	N
.	N
	
Once	N
everyone	N
who	N
need	N
off	N
was	N
off	N
,	N
I	N
climbed	N
up	N
the	N
stairs	N
,	N
smiled	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
,	N
and	N
put	N
my	N
money	N
in	N
the	N
slot	C
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
a	N
seat	N
and	N
off	N
we	N
went	N
.	N
	
I	N
watched	N
all	N
the	N
buildings	N
go	N
by	N
as	N
the	N
driver	N
drove	N
the	N
bus	N
towards	N
the	N
zoo	N
.	N
	
There	N
were	N
a	N
couple	N
of	N
other	N
stops	N
before	N
the	N
zoo	N
,	N
and	N
at	N
each	N
one	N
people	N
got	N
off	N
the	N
bus	N
and	N
on	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
,	N
we	N
made	N
it	N
to	N
the	N
zoo	N
.	N
	
The	N
driver	N
opened	N
up	N
the	N
door	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
climbed	N
down	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
bus	N
and	N
off	N
to	N
my	N
day	N
at	N
the	N
zoo	N
.	N
	
Tonight	N
I	N
road	N
on	N
a	N
public	N
bus	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
outside	N
of	N
the	N
store	N
near	N
my	N
house	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
which	N
runs	N
on	N
a	N
schedule	C
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
bus	N
came	N
I	N
got	N
on	N
and	N
paid	N
the	N
bus	N
fare	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
I	N
took	N
my	N
seat	N
I	N
looked	N
around	N
at	N
all	N
the	N
other	N
people	N
.	N
	
When	N
you	N
ride	N
on	N
the	N
bus	N
there	N
can	N
be	N
all	N
types	N
of	N
people	N
on	N
the	N
bus	N
with	N
you	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
my	N
MP3	N
player	N
with	N
me	N
with	N
ear-buds	N
so	N
I	N
put	N
my	N
ear-buds	N
into	N
my	N
ears	N
and	N
turned	N
on	N
my	N
MP3	N
player	N
and	N
began	N
listening	N
to	N
my	N
music	N
.	N
	
My	N
public	N
bus	N
ride	N
was	N
n't	N
very	N
long	N
so	N
after	N
a	N
little	N
while	N
the	N
bus	N
stopped	N
at	N
my	N
stop	N
and	N
I	N
got	N
off	N
the	N
bus	N
and	N
arrived	N
at	N
my	N
destination	N
.	N
	
Riding	N
on	N
a	N
public	N
bus	N
can	N
be	N
a	N
fun	N
experience	N
if	N
you	N
want	N
it	N
to	N
be	N
and	N
you	N
can	N
even	N
talk	N
to	N
the	N
other	N
people	N
on	N
the	N
public	N
bus	N
but	N
overall	C
I	N
had	N
a	N
good	N
experience	N
.	N
	
There	N
is	N
a	N
bus	N
stop	N
down	N
the	N
street	N
from	N
my	N
house	N
.	N
	
If	N
you	N
take	N
it	N
going	N
south	N
,	N
it	N
leads	N
to	N
the	N
city	N
,	N
and	N
if	N
you	N
take	N
it	N
going	N
north	N
,	N
it	N
leads	N
to	N
the	N
next	N
suburban	N
town	N
.	N
	
I	N
needed	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
city	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
and	N
waited	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
about	N
ten	N
minutes	N
and	N
then	N
the	N
bus	N
came	N
.	N
	
It	N
wheezed	N
to	N
a	N
stop	N
near	N
me	N
and	N
then	N
the	N
door	N
opened	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
into	N
the	N
bus	N
and	N
up	N
the	N
short	N
flight	N
of	N
stairs	N
toward	N
the	N
driver	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
just	N
enough	N
change	N
on	N
me	N
to	N
pay	N
the	N
fare	N
.	N
	
I	N
fed	N
my	N
coins	N
into	N
the	N
slot	C
where	N
you	N
put	N
your	N
money	N
and	N
then	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
left	N
and	N
down	N
the	N
aisle	N
to	N
find	N
my	N
seat	N
.	N
	
I	N
passed	N
the	N
front	N
seats	N
,	N
which	N
are	N
intended	N
for	N
older	N
or	N
handicapped	N
passengers	N
,	N
and	N
took	N
a	N
seat	N
about	N
halfway	N
down	N
the	N
bus	N
,	N
next	N
to	N
the	N
window	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
ride	N
lasted	N
15	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
saw	N
that	N
my	N
stop	N
would	N
be	N
next	N
,	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
yellow	N
cord	N
that	N
runs	N
along	N
the	N
side	N
of	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
That	N
makes	N
a	N
beep	N
and	N
signals	N
the	N
driver	N
that	N
someone	N
wants	N
to	N
get	N
off	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
The	N
beep	N
sounded	N
and	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
pulled	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
side	N
of	N
the	N
road	N
at	N
the	N
next	N
bus	N
stop	N
.	N
	
The	N
doors	N
opened	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
up	N
and	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
rear	C
door	N
of	N
the	N
bus	N
,	N
walked	N
down	N
the	N
stairs	N
,	N
and	N
walked	N
out	N
onto	N
the	N
sidewalk	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
for	N
my	N
bus	N
to	N
come	N
pick	N
me	N
up	N
.	N
	
It	N
seemed	N
to	N
be	N
running	N
a	N
little	N
behind	N
today	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
,	N
at	N
8:03	N
,	N
the	N
bus	N
pulled	N
up	N
.	N
	
There	N
were	N
other	N
people	N
at	N
the	N
stop	N
as	N
well	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
waited	N
in	N
lined	N
for	N
my	N
turn	N
to	N
get	N
on	N
.	N
	
I	N
climbed	N
the	N
three	N
steps	N
up	N
into	N
the	N
bus	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
deposited	N
my	N
change	N
to	N
pay	N
for	N
the	N
trip	N
.	N
	
The	N
fare	N
was	N
$	N
1.5	N
so	N
I	N
put	N
six	N
quarters	N
into	N
the	N
box	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
walked	N
down	N
the	N
aisle	N
of	N
the	N
bus	N
and	N
looked	N
for	N
an	N
empty	N
seat	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
one	N
next	N
to	N
a	N
young	N
person	N
listening	N
to	N
music	N
on	N
their	N
headphones	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
pulled	N
away	N
from	N
the	N
curb	C
.	N
	
As	N
we	N
rode	N
,	N
I	N
looked	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
and	N
watched	N
the	N
stores	N
and	N
houses	N
pass	N
by	N
.	N
	
After	N
about	N
10	N
minutes	N
,	N
we	N
reached	N
my	N
stop	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
come	N
to	N
a	N
complete	N
stop	N
and	N
then	N
exited	N
,	N
steeping	N
down	N
and	N
then	N
stepping	N
back	N
up	N
the	N
curb	C
onto	N
the	N
sidewalk	N
.	N
	
Time	N
to	N
start	N
another	N
day	N
!	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
college	N
in	N
a	N
big	N
city	N
and	N
did	N
n't	N
have	N
a	N
car	N
on	N
campus	C
.	N
	
Thankfully	C
,	N
there	N
was	N
n't	N
a	N
need	N
for	N
one	N
because	N
the	N
public	N
transportation	C
system	N
was	N
great	N
.	N
	
I	N
often	N
went	N
to	N
visit	N
my	N
friend	N
that	N
went	N
to	N
school	N
on	N
the	N
other	N
side	N
of	N
town	N
.	N
	
I	N
always	N
took	N
a	N
public	N
bus	N
to	N
get	N
there	N
.	N
	
The	N
first	N
thing	N
I	N
would	N
do	N
is	N
look	N
up	N
the	N
bus	N
route	N
and	N
schedule	C
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
knew	N
what	N
time	N
the	N
bus	N
would	N
arrive	N
,	N
I	N
'd	N
walk	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
and	N
wait	N
on	N
the	N
bench	C
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
bus	N
arrived	N
,	N
I	N
would	N
pay	N
the	N
driver	N
via	N
a	N
electronic	N
machine	N
and	N
was	N
then	N
on	N
my	N
life	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
would	N
make	N
many	N
stops	N
before	N
arriving	N
at	N
mine	N
.	N
	
At	N
one	N
point	N
,	N
the	N
bus	N
was	N
full	N
and	N
I	N
gave	N
up	N
my	N
seat	N
so	N
that	N
an	N
older	N
lady	N
could	N
sit	N
down	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
saw	N
that	N
my	N
stop	N
was	N
arriving	N
,	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
lever	N
to	N
let	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
know	N
that	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
depart	N
the	N
bus	N
at	N
the	N
next	N
stop	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
thanked	N
the	N
driver	N
and	N
was	N
on	N
my	N
way	N
.	N
	
I	N
really	N
like	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
bus	N
when	N
I	N
have	N
to	N
run	N
errands	N
.	N
	
There	N
is	N
a	N
bus	N
stop	N
right	N
outside	N
of	N
my	N
apartment	N
building	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
have	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
,	N
I	N
wait	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
bus	N
pulls	N
up	N
,	N
I	N
pay	N
the	N
bus	N
fare	N
using	N
quarters	N
.	N
	
It	N
costs	N
six	N
quarters	N
to	N
ride	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
makes	N
lots	N
of	N
different	N
stops	N
before	N
it	N
gets	N
to	N
the	N
grocery	N
store	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
am	N
on	N
it	N
for	N
several	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
I	N
sit	N
quietly	N
in	N
my	N
seat	N
.	N
	
Sometimes	N
other	N
people	N
on	N
the	N
bus	N
will	N
say	N
hello	N
and	N
we	N
will	N
have	N
a	N
small	N
conversation	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
get	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
and	N
finish	N
shopping	N
,	N
I	N
wait	N
at	N
another	N
bus	N
stop	N
so	N
I	N
can	N
go	N
home	N
.	N
	
I	N
pay	N
the	N
bus	N
fare	N
again	N
,	N
sit	N
in	N
my	N
seat	N
and	N
patiently	C
wait	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
get	N
to	N
my	N
apartment	N
.	N
	
When	N
it	N
stops	N
in	N
front	N
of	N
my	N
apartment	N
,	N
I	N
get	N
off	N
the	N
bus	N
and	N
go	N
inside	N
.	N
	
I	N
needed	N
to	N
get	N
from	N
my	N
house	N
to	N
work	N
,	N
but	N
my	N
car	N
wouldn	N
'	N
t	N
start	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
my	N
best	N
option	N
was	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
down	N
the	N
street	N
to	N
the	N
nearest	N
bus	N
stop	N
that	N
would	N
take	N
me	N
close	N
to	N
work	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
for	N
about	N
five	N
minutes	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
come	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
got	N
on	N
,	N
I	N
put	N
my	N
money	N
in	N
the	N
machine	N
and	N
headed	N
towards	N
the	N
back	N
to	N
find	N
a	N
seat	N
.	N
	
There	N
were	N
only	N
three	N
open	N
seats	N
so	N
I	N
took	N
one	N
of	N
them	N
and	N
popped	N
in	N
my	N
ear	N
buds	N
to	N
listen	N
to	N
music	N
.	N
	
I	N
also	N
brought	N
a	N
book	N
along	N
to	N
read	N
so	N
nobody	N
would	N
try	N
to	N
talk	N
to	N
me	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
made	N
three	N
stops	N
before	N
we	N
got	N
to	N
the	N
corner	N
nearest	N
to	N
my	N
work	N
.	N
	
Each	N
time	N
people	N
would	N
get	N
off	N
and	N
as	N
they	N
shuffled	N
past	N
would	N
bump	C
into	N
my	N
knees	N
which	N
was	N
really	N
annoying	N
.	N
	
Then	N
more	N
people	N
would	N
get	N
on	N
and	N
some	N
would	N
find	N
seats	N
,	N
but	N
others	N
had	N
to	N
stand	N
.	N
	
One	N
person	N
stood	N
directly	N
in	N
front	N
of	N
me	N
,	N
in	N
constant	C
contact	N
with	N
my	N
legs	N
.	N
	
This	N
really	N
annoyed	N
me	N
even	N
more	N
.	N
	
I	N
don	N
'	N
t	N
like	N
riding	N
public	N
transportation	C
.	N
	
Finally	N
we	N
got	N
to	N
my	N
stop	N
and	N
I	N
got	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
bus	N
through	N
the	N
rear	C
doors	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
waiting	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
,	N
and	N
as	N
it	N
was	N
a	N
very	N
hot	N
day	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
happy	N
for	N
the	N
shady	N
bench	C
.	N
	
More	N
people	N
gathered	N
around	N
the	N
stop	N
,	N
getting	N
on	N
and	N
off	N
other	N
buses	N
,	N
as	N
I	N
waited	N
for	N
my	N
bus	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
,	N
a	N
bus	N
with	N
my	N
number	N
on	N
it	N
,	N
arrived	N
.	N
	
It	N
felt	N
a	N
little	N
like	N
a	N
rush	C
to	N
get	N
on	N
,	N
by	N
finally	N
I	N
had	N
paid	N
my	N
fair	N
,	N
and	N
looked	N
for	N
a	N
place	N
to	N
sit	N
.	N
	
Not	N
finding	N
a	N
seat	N
,	N
I	N
placed	N
my	N
shopping	N
bag	N
between	N
my	N
feet	N
and	N
stood	N
for	N
a	N
few	N
stops	N
,	N
holding	N
the	N
handhold	N
hanging	N
from	N
the	N
ceiling	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
the	N
bus	N
cleared	N
out	N
a	N
little	N
and	N
I	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
find	N
a	N
place	N
to	N
sit	N
.	N
	
I	N
read	N
my	N
book	N
,	N
looking	N
occasionally	C
out	N
the	N
windows	N
,	N
and	N
listening	N
for	N
information	N
on	N
the	N
next	N
stop	N
,	N
until	N
finally	N
reaching	N
the	N
stop	N
for	N
home	N
.	N
	
Even	N
though	N
I	N
stepped	N
carefully	N
off	N
the	N
bus	N
,	N
I	N
did	N
stumble	C
slightly	C
on	N
one	N
the	N
steps	N
.	N
	
I	N
promised	N
myself	N
to	N
be	N
more	N
careful	N
in	N
the	N
future	N
.	N
	
I	N
needed	N
to	N
get	N
to	N
work	N
,	N
but	N
my	N
car	N
was	N
not	N
working	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
public	N
bus	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
and	N
sat	N
down	N
on	N
the	N
bench	C
that	N
was	N
provided	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
until	N
the	N
bus	N
that	N
I	N
needed	N
pulled	N
up	N
and	N
boarded	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
I	N
paid	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
the	N
fare	N
and	N
took	N
a	N
seat	N
.	N
	
I	N
sat	N
on	N
the	N
bus	N
as	N
it	N
passed	N
by	N
all	N
the	N
stops	N
that	N
we	N
drove	N
past	N
until	N
we	N
reached	N
the	N
stop	N
that	N
I	N
needed	N
.	N
	
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
bell	N
to	N
alarm	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
that	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
get	N
off	N
at	N
the	N
next	N
stop	N
.	N
	
He	N
stopped	N
when	N
we	N
arrived	N
and	N
I	N
got	N
off	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
made	N
it	N
my	N
work	N
right	N
on	N
time	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
from	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
a	N
couple	N
blocks	N
down	N
the	N
street	N
until	N
I	N
reached	N
my	N
job	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
entered	N
my	N
work	N
and	N
began	N
working	N
at	N
my	N
job	N
.	N
	
Yesterday	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bus	N
to	N
visit	N
my	N
friends	N
at	N
the	N
beach	N
.	N
	
I	N
checked	N
the	N
bus	N
schedule	C
on	N
my	N
computer	N
.	N
	
Around	N
the	N
time	N
the	N
bus	N
would	N
be	N
in	N
the	N
area	N
,	N
I	N
walked	N
from	N
my	N
house	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
.	N
	
I	N
wanted	N
with	N
other	N
riders	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N
	
When	N
it	N
did	N
,	N
I	N
boarded	N
the	N
bus	N
and	N
paid	N
for	N
my	N
ride	N
with	N
coins	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
took	N
the	N
first	N
available	N
seat	N
towards	N
the	N
front	N
of	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
There	N
was	N
a	N
older	N
lady	N
seated	N
next	N
to	N
me	N
and	N
we	N
had	N
a	N
nice	N
conversation	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
stopped	N
at	N
various	N
locations	N
and	N
people	N
got	N
on	N
and	N
off	N
.	N
	
When	N
a	N
pregnant	N
woman	N
got	N
on	N
the	N
bus	N
,	N
I	N
stood	N
up	N
and	N
let	N
her	N
have	N
my	N
seat	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
stood	N
and	N
held	N
the	N
pole	C
in	N
the	N
middle	C
of	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
keep	N
stable	C
as	N
the	N
bus	N
lurched	N
during	N
it	N
's	N
starts	N
and	N
stops	N
.	N
	
Before	N
long	N
,	N
the	N
bus	N
arrived	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
closest	N
to	N
the	N
beach	N
and	N
I	N
exited	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
meet	N
my	N
friends	N
.	N
	
The	N
trick	N
to	N
getting	N
around	N
an	N
island	N
as	N
congested	N
with	N
traffic	N
as	N
Oahu	N
,	N
is	N
to	N
ride	N
the	N
public	N
bus	N
.	N
	
There	N
are	N
too	N
many	N
cars	N
,	N
in	N
too	N
small	N
of	N
an	N
area	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
result	N
is	N
hours	N
of	N
gridlock	N
on	N
the	N
roads	N
.	N
	
The	N
bus	N
can	N
use	N
special	N
lanes	N
,	N
and	N
helps	N
reduce	N
the	N
overall	C
traffic	N
.	N
	
Learning	C
to	N
ride	N
the	N
public	N
bus	N
was	N
a	N
little	N
stressful	N
at	N
first	N
.	N
	
I	N
studied	N
bus	N
routes	N
online	N
on	N
their	N
website	N
,	N
there	N
are	N
quite	N
a	N
few	N
and	N
it	N
seemed	N
like	N
it	N
'd	N
be	N
easy	N
to	N
get	N
on	N
the	N
wrong	N
bus	N
.	N
	
I	N
learned	N
each	N
bus	N
has	N
a	N
number	N
assigned	N
to	N
it	N
and	N
displayed	N
on	N
the	N
front	N
though	N
.	N
	
With	N
that	N
in	N
mind	N
,	N
and	N
armed	C
with	N
maps	N
,	N
I	N
learned	N
to	N
stand	N
at	N
my	N
local	N
bus	N
stop	N
and	N
climb	N
on	N
board	N
where	N
I	N
drop	N
my	N
change	N
into	N
the	N
toll	C
taker	N
next	N
to	N
the	N
driver	N
.	N
	
I	N
always	N
look	N
for	N
an	N
empty	N
seat	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
relax	N
,	N
watching	N
the	N
scenery	N
roll	N
by	N
.	N
	
As	N
my	N
stop	N
approaches	N
,	N
I	N
stand	N
and	N
pull	N
the	N
bell	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
driver	N
stops	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
Now	N
that	N
I	N
regularly	N
ride	N
the	N
public	N
bus	N
,	N
I	N
find	N
I	N
do	N
n't	N
mind	N
the	N
long	N
commute	C
nearly	N
as	N
much	N
!	N
Do	N
n't	N
own	N
a	N
car	N
?	N
Tired	N
of	N
walking	N
around	N
?	N
Well	N
I	N
have	N
a	N
perfect	N
solution	N
for	N
you	N
,	N
and	N
it	N
's	N
right	N
under	N
your	N
nose	N
.	N
	
Head	N
to	N
your	N
local	N
corner	N
bus	N
stop	N
and	N
travel	N
on	N
another	N
form	N
of	N
transportation	C
!	N
It	N
's	N
very	N
simple	N
if	N
you	N
live	N
in	N
an	N
Urban	C
setting	C
,	N
and	N
still	N
pretty	N
simple	N
in	N
the	N
suburbs	N
.	N
	
A	N
good	N
resource	C
first	N
is	N
to	N
look	N
up	N
a	N
bus	N
schedule	C
on	N
the	N
internet	N
.	N
	
Additionally	C
,	N
you	N
could	N
search	N
the	N
sidewalks	N
for	N
prominent	C
signage	N
that	N
indicates	N
a	N
bus	N
will	N
stop	N
in	N
your	N
area	N
.	N
	
Once	N
you	N
decide	N
on	N
where	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
go	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
time	N
at	N
which	N
the	N
bus	N
comes	N
,	N
just	N
head	N
out	N
to	N
this	N
stop	N
and	N
simply	C
wait	N
.	N
	
A	N
bus	N
will	N
eventually	C
show	N
up	N
where	N
you	N
can	N
board	N
and	N
pay	N
directly	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
.	N
	
Once	N
paid	N
,	N
simply	C
find	N
an	N
open	N
seat	N
and	N
gaze	C
out	N
the	N
window	N
at	N
the	N
bustling	N
of	N
life	N
that	N
you	N
are	N
passing	N
by	N
.	N
	
Eventually	C
you	N
will	N
arrive	N
at	N
your	N
destination	N
and	N
can	N
exit	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N
	
Once	N
you	N
finish	N
running	N
your	N
errands	N
simply	C
return	N
to	N
another	N
bus	N
spot	N
and	N
find	N
a	N
ride	N
home	N
.	N
	
I	N
like	N
to	N
cook	N
a	N
lot	N
but	N
I	N
am	N
not	N
a	N
very	N
good	N
baker	N
.	N
	
So	N
I	N
never	N
bake	N
cakes	N
from	N
scratch	C
.	N
	
However	N
I	N
do	N
like	N
cake	N
al	N
ot	N
so	N
I	N
do	N
bake	N
them	N
.	N
	
I	N
use	N
box	N
mixes	N
.	N
	
They	N
are	N
easy	N
to	N
use	N
and	N
make	N
a	N
very	N
nice	N
cake	N
.	N
	
it	N
really	N
does	N
n't	N
take	N
much	N
time	N
.	N
	
All	N
you	N
need	N
to	N
do	N
is	N
get	N
one	N
bowl	N
.	N
	
Add	N
the	N
cake	N
mix	N
from	N
the	N
box	N
.	N
	
Either	N
2	N
or	N
3	N
eggs	N
added	N
to	N
the	N
bowl	N
.	N
	
Then	N
a	N
half	N
cup	N
of	N
oil	N
and	N
finally	N
about	N
a	N
cup	N
of	N
water	N
.	N
	
Then	N
you	N
need	N
to	N
get	N
your	N
mixer	N
and	N
put	N
it	N
on	N
medium	N
and	N
mix	N
it	N
all	N
up	N
for	N
2	N
to	N
3	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
Then	N
put	N
it	N
into	N
a	N
non	N
stick	N
cake	N
pan	N
and	N
bake	N
for	N
about	N
30	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
So	N
all	N
together	N
about	N
10	N
minutes	N
preparation	N
and	N
30	N
minutes	N
baking	N
you	N
can	N
have	N
a	N
good	N
tasting	N
cake	N
in	N
40	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
.	N
	
I	N
do	N
n't	N
really	N
like	N
frosting	N
so	N
as	N
soon	N
as	N
it	N
cools	N
I	N
cut	N
myself	N
a	N
slice	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
my	N
son	N
's	N
birthday	N
so	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
bake	N
him	N
a	N
birthday	N
cake	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
and	N
bought	N
chocolate	N
cake	N
mix	N
,	N
oil	N
,	N
eggs	N
,	N
and	N
frosting	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
set	N
about	N
making	N
the	N
cake	N
.	N
	
I	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
oven	N
to	N
preheat	N
it	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
big	N
bowl	N
to	N
mix	N
everything	N
in	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
in	N
the	N
cake	N
mix	N
,	N
the	N
oil	N
and	N
eggs	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
found	C
the	N
electric	N
beaters	N
and	N
beat	N
the	N
concoction	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
smooth	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
grabbed	N
the	N
pan	N
that	N
the	N
cake	N
would	N
be	N
baked	N
in	N
and	N
greased	N
the	N
sides	N
of	N
it	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
poured	N
the	N
cake	N
batter	N
into	N
the	N
pan	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
put	N
the	N
pan	N
into	N
the	N
oven	N
that	N
had	N
been	N
preheated	N
.	N
	
I	N
set	N
a	N
timer	N
to	N
thirty	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
timer	N
went	N
off	N
I	N
stuck	C
a	N
knife	N
into	N
the	N
cake	N
to	N
see	N
if	N
it	N
was	N
done	N
cooking	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
try	N
baking	N
a	N
cake	N
for	N
the	N
first	N
time	N
.	N
	
Even	N
though	N
I	N
was	N
n't	N
too	N
sure	N
about	N
how	N
to	N
do	N
it	N
,	N
I	N
figured	N
I	N
would	N
have	N
fun	N
trying	N
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
up	N
the	N
recipe	N
online	N
and	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
to	N
buy	N
all	N
the	N
ingredients	N
.	N
	
I	N
set	N
everything	N
on	N
the	N
kitchen	N
counter	C
and	N
went	N
to	N
work	N
.	N
	
I	N
first	N
opened	N
all	N
the	N
packages	N
of	N
the	N
ingredients	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
followed	N
the	N
recipe	N
in	N
full	N
detail	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
I	N
did	N
it	N
correctly	N
.	N
	
As	N
soon	N
as	N
I	N
had	N
everything	N
properly	N
mixed	N
,	N
I	N
pre-heated	N
the	N
oven	N
and	N
made	N
sure	N
it	N
was	N
at	N
the	N
right	N
temperature	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
timer	N
indicated	N
the	N
oven	N
was	N
ready	N
,	N
I	N
put	N
the	N
cake	N
tray	C
with	N
the	N
mixed	N
cake	N
batter	N
inside	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
for	N
forty	N
minutes	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
ready	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
cake	N
and	N
put	N
chocolate	N
frosting	N
on	N
top	N
.	N
	
The	N
cake	N
came	N
out	N
pretty	N
well	N
for	N
my	N
first	N
time	N
baking	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
bake	N
a	N
cake	N
for	N
my	N
friend	N
's	N
birthday	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
and	N
purchased	N
all	N
the	N
necessary	N
ingredients	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
got	N
home	N
,	N
I	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
oven	N
to	N
let	N
it	N
preheat	N
.	N
	
I	N
opened	N
the	N
box	N
of	N
cake	N
mix	N
and	N
poured	N
it	N
into	N
a	N
bowl	N
.	N
	
Following	C
the	N
instructions	N
,	N
I	N
mixed	N
in	N
oil	N
,	N
eggs	N
,	N
and	N
water	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
blended	N
well	N
.	N
	
I	N
poured	N
the	N
batter	N
into	N
a	N
cake	N
pan	N
and	N
put	N
it	N
into	N
the	N
oven	N
to	N
bake	N
.	N
	
While	N
the	N
cake	N
was	N
baking	N
,	N
I	N
prepared	N
the	N
frosting	N
by	N
mixing	N
powdered	N
sugar	N
,	N
butter	N
,	N
milk	N
and	N
vanilla	N
.	N
	
I	N
also	N
added	N
some	N
blue	N
food	N
dye	N
to	N
make	N
the	N
cake	N
blue	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
cake	N
was	N
finished	N
baking	N
and	N
cooling	N
off	N
,	N
I	N
iced	N
the	N
cake	N
with	N
the	N
frosting	N
.	N
	
When	N
it	N
was	N
covered	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
some	N
sprinkles	N
and	N
wrote	N
``	N
``	N
Happy	N
Birthday	N
Joshua	N
``	N
``	N
across	N
the	N
top	N
.	N
	
I	N
added	N
some	N
candies	N
around	N
the	N
edges	N
and	N
finished	N
by	N
putting	N
the	N
birthday	N
candles	N
on	N
the	N
cake	N
.	N
	
I	N
brought	N
the	N
cake	N
to	N
his	N
birthday	N
party	N
and	N
everybody	N
loved	N
it	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
my	N
girlfriend	N
's	N
birthday	N
so	N
I	N
baked	N
her	N
a	N
cake	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
nothing	N
fancy	N
,	N
just	N
a	N
cake	N
from	N
a	N
box	N
.	N
	
I	N
mixed	N
all	N
the	N
ingredients	N
together	N
after	N
I	N
preheated	N
the	N
oven	N
to	N
the	N
appropriate	C
temperature	N
.	N
	
After	N
mixing	N
the	N
ingredients	N
I	N
poured	N
them	N
into	N
a	N
baking	N
pan	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
put	N
the	N
pan	N
in	N
the	N
oven	N
.	N
	
While	N
I	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
cake	N
to	N
cook	N
I	N
made	N
an	N
icing	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
top	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
it	N
from	N
cream	N
cheese	N
and	N
strawberries	N
which	N
I	N
whipped	N
together	N
with	N
sugar	N
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
cake	N
was	N
done	N
baking	N
I	N
pulled	N
it	N
from	N
the	N
oven	N
and	N
set	N
it	N
aside	C
to	N
cool	N

After	N
it	N
was	N
cool	N
I	N
frosted	N
it	N
with	N
my	N
homemade	N
icing	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
piped	N
her	N
name	N
on	N
top	N
in	N
fancy	N
lettering	N
.	N
	
Once	N
that	N
was	N
done	N
I	N
placed	N
it	N
on	N
a	N
fancy	N
cake	N
tray	C
and	N
waited	N
for	N
her	N
to	N
arrive	N
home	N
so	N
we	N
could	N
eat	N
the	N
cake	N
together	N
.	N
	
My	N
friend	N
and	N
his	N
wife	N
have	N
a	N
dessert	N
business	N
and	N
baking	N
cakes	N
is	N
their	N
specialty	N
.	N
	
Often	N
,	N
they	N
'll	N
call	N
me	N
up	N
to	N
help	N
them	N
out	N
in	N
the	N
shop	N
for	N
a	N
few	N
extra	N
dollars	N
if	N
I	N
have	N
the	N
time	N
.	N
	
I	N
am	N
always	N
up	N
to	N
doing	N
it	N
!	N
It	N
is	N
messy	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
is	N
fun	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
can	N
lick	C
the	N
spoon	N

Anyway	N
,	N
they	N
were	N
baking	N
a	N
few	N
cakes	N
the	N
other	N
day	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
came	N
over	N
just	N
in	N
time	N
to	N
help	N
them	N
with	N
their	N
last	N
order	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
on	N
my	N
apron	N
as	N
we	N
got	N
out	N
the	N
flour	N
,	N
eggs	N
,	N
sugar	N
,	N
butter	N
,	N
and	N
cake	N
mix	N
.	N
	
We	N
poured	N
the	N
cake	N
mix	N
,	N
sugar	N
,	N
and	N
flour	N
in	N
a	N
bowl	N
while	N
we	N
melted	N
the	N
butter	N
and	N
mixed	N
it	N
in	N
with	N
the	N
eggs	N
and	N
some	N
added	N
water	N
.	N
	
Then	N
,	N
we	N
mixed	N
everything	N
together	N
with	N
a	N
beater	N
.	N
	
I	N
swear	C
,	N
that	N
is	N
always	N
the	N
best	N
part	N
of	N
baking	N
a	N
cake	N
!	N
I	N
licked	N
the	N
little	N
beater	N
things	N
clean	N
while	N
my	N
friend	N
's	N
wife	N
greased	N
the	N
pans	N
.	N
	
We	N
then	N
pour	N
the	N
cake	N
batter	N
into	N
the	N
pans	N
and	N
put	N
it	N
into	N
the	N
oven	N
which	N
had	N
already	N
been	N
preheated	N
to	N
350	N
degrees	N
.	N
	
We	N
left	N
them	N
in	N
the	N
oven	N
for	N
25	N
minutes	N
and	N
once	N
they	N
were	N
done	N
,	N
we	N
got	N
them	N
out	N
and	N
put	N
them	N
on	N
a	N
window	N
sill	N
to	N
cool	N
.	N
	
Ah	N
,	N
the	N
smell	N
was	N
wonderful	N
!	N
This	N
weekend	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
do	N
something	N
special	N
with	N
my	N
son	N
.	N
	
He	N
been	N
asking	N
me	N
to	N
bake	N
a	N
cake	N
with	N
him	N
so	N
I	N
figured	N
today	N
would	N
be	N
a	N
good	N
day	N
to	N
do	N
so	N
.	N
	
We	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
and	N
bought	N
all	N
the	N
ingredients	N
we	N
needed	N
.	N
	
We	N
bought	N
eggs	N
,	N
milk	N
,	N
cake	N
mix	N
,	N
and	N
even	N
frosting	N
.	N
	
When	N
we	N
got	N
back	N
home	N
I	N
took	N
out	N
my	N
measuring	N
cup	N
and	N
showed	N
him	N
how	N
to	N
measure	C
how	N
much	N
milk	N
we	N
needed	N
to	N
add	N
to	N
the	N
cake	N
mix	N
.	N
	
Then	N
we	N
both	N
proceeded	N
to	N
crack	C
a	N
couple	N
eggs	N
and	N
add	N
it	N
to	N
the	N
mix	N
as	N
well	N
.	N
	
I	N
gave	N
him	N
the	N
hand	N
mixer	N
and	N
he	N
started	N
mixing	N
it	N
all	N
together	N
in	N
a	N
large	N
bowl	N
.	N
	
I	N
could	N
tell	N

was	N
having	N
a	N
great	N
time	N
.	N
	
After	N
he	N
finished	N
mixing	N
the	N
the	N

batter	N
,	N
I	N
slowly	N
poured	N
it	N

when	N
it	N

hot	N
enough	N

After	N

It	N

I	N

We	N
have	N
a	N
family	N
recipe	N

when	N
I	N
cook	N
.	N
	
First	N
I	N
purchase	C

at	N
the	N

make	N
certain	N
I	N
have	N
everything	N

Then	N
I	N
make	N
a	N
crust	N

using	N
crumbled	N
cookies	N
,	N
nuts	N

I	N
turn	N

pre-heat	N
,	N
as	N
my	N
oven	N
is	N
very	N
slow	N
to	N
heat	N
up	N
.	N
	
I	N
use	N
my	N
electric	N
mixer	N
to	N
whip	N
the	N
pats	N
of	N
cream	N
cheese	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N

place	N
it	N
in	N
the	N

Then	N
it	N

I	N

It	N
's	N
something	N
we	N

Mom	N
decided	N
she	N
was	N
going	N
to	N
make	N
a	N
chocolate	N
cake	N
,	N
and	N
chocolate	N
is	N
my	N

First	N
,	N
we	N
washed	N
our	N
hands	N
carefully	N
with	N
plenty	N
of	N
soap	N
.	N
	
Then	N
we	N
dried	N
our	N
hands	N
.	N
	
The	N
first	N
thing	N
we	N
had	N
to	N
do	N
was	N
sift	N
the	N
dry	N
ingredients	N
.	N
	
Mom	N
got	N
out	N
a	N
really	N
big	N
mixing	N
bowl	N
made	N
of	N
aluminum	N
.	N
	
We	N
put	N
in	N
the	N
flour	N
,	N
sugar	N
,	N
salt	N
,	N
and	N
baking	N
powder	N
.	N
	
Mom	N
likes	N
turbinado	N
sugar	N
the	N
best	N
because	N
it	N
's	N
more	N
healthy	N
,	N
so	N
we	N
used	N
that	N
.	N
	
The	N
four	N
was	N
King	N
Arthur	N
cake	N
flour	N
.	N
	
We	N
blended	N
the	N
dry	N
ingredients	N
carefully	N
with	N
a	N
whip	N
.	N
	
Then	N
we	N
got	N
another	N
bowl	N
and	N
mixed	N
the	N
eggs	N
,	N
milk	N
,	N
and	N
butter	N
.	N
	
Mom	N
took	N
a	N
little	N

and	N
melted	N
the	N
chocolate	N
on	N
the	N
stove	N
on	N
very	N
low	N
heat	N

We	N
mixed	N
the	N
chocolate	N
with	N
the	N
liquids	N
and	N
then	N
poured	N
it	N
all	N
into	N
the	N
big	N
bowl	N
.	N
	
We	N
baked	N
the	N
cake	N
for	N
40	N
minutes	N
--	N
it	N
seemed	N
like	N
a	N
long	N
time	N
!	N
--	N
and	N
after	N
it	N
cooled	N
we	N
iced	N
it	N

,	N
but	N
I	N
was	N
not	N
sure	N
how	N
to	N
do	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
and	N
buy	N
a	N
box	N
of	N
cake	N
mix	N
.	N
	
The	N
box	N

that	N
I	N
would	N
need	N
oil	N
and	N
eggs	N
to	N
make	N
the	N
cake	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
bought	N
those	N
items	N
,	N
too	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
got	N
home	N
,	N
I	N
followed	N

the	N
box	N

I	N

350	N
degrees	N
and	N
sprayed	N
a	N

I	N
mixed	N
together	N
the	N
cake	N

Once	N

I	N

I	N
put	N
the	N

and	N
set	N

When	N
the	N

I	N
took	N
my	N

out	N
of	N
the	N

It	N
looked	N

After	N

I	N
put	N

My	N

enjoyed	N
his	N

into	N
the	N
mixing	N

After	N
all	N
the	N

After	N

so	N
it	N
would	N
be	N
hot	N
and	N
ready	N
for	N
the	N
cake	N
and	N
then	N
got	N
out	N
my	N
bowls	N
and	N
measuring	N
cups	N
and	N
spoons	N
.	N
	
I	N
mixed	N
all	N
the	N
ingredients	N
in	N
a	N
bowl	N
then	N
got	N
out	N
a	N
cake	N
pan	N
and	N
greased	N
it	N
with	N
butter	N
so	N
the	N
cake	N
would	N
not	N
stick	N
,	N
poured	N
the	N
cake	N
batter	N
in	N
the	N
pan	N
and	N
put	N
the	N
pan	N
in	N
the	N
oven	N
to	N
bake	N
.	N
	
I	N
set	N
the	N
timer	N
on	N
the	N
oven	N
so	N
it	N
would	N
beep	N
when	N
the	N
cake	N
was	N
done	N
,	N
then	N
cleaned	N
up	N
the	N
bowls	N
and	N
spoons	N
I	N
had	N
used	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
cake	N
was	N
done	N
I	N
took	N
it	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
oven	N
and	N
let	N
it	N
cool	N
then	N
decorated	N
it	N
with	N
frosting	N
and	N
candles	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
saw	N
my	N
friend	N
later	N
that	N
day	N
,	N
I	N
lit	N
the	N
candles	N
and	N
sang	N
Happy	N
Birthday	N
to	N
her	N
.	N
	
She	N
really	N
liked	N
her	N
cake	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
my	N
mom	N
's	N
birthday	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
bake	N
her	N
a	N
special	N
cake	N
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
in	N
my	N
cabinet	C
and	N
saw	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
everything	N
except	N
vanilla	N
and	N
frosting	N
.	N
	
I	N
drove	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
and	N
got	N
the	N
ingredients	N
I	N
needed	N
and	N
went	N
back	N
home	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
was	N
home	N
I	N
began	N
mixing	N
the	N
cake	N
ingredients	N
together	N
in	N
a	N
large	N
bowl	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
took	N
out	N
a	N
cake	N
sheet	N
and	N
poured	N
the	N
cake	N
batter	N
into	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
preheated	N
the	N
oven	N
and	N
placed	N
the	N
cake	N
in	N
the	N
oven	N
.	N
	
I	N
began	N
working	N
on	N
my	N
frosting	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
out	N
some	N
butter	N
and	N
sugar	N
and	N
mixed	N
them	N
together	N
adding	N
a	N
few	N
more	N
ingredients	N
to	N
taste	N
as	N
I	N
went	N
.	N
	
I	N
checked	N
the	N
cake	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
done	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
the	N
cake	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
oven	N
and	N
let	N
it	N
cool	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
frosted	N
the	N
cake	N
and	N
decorated	N
it	N
as	N
well	N
.	N
	
After	N
dinner	N
my	N
mom	N
blew	N
out	N
the	N
candles	N
on	N
the	N
cake	N
and	N
everyone	N
said	N
how	N
tasty	N
it	N
was	N
to	N
eat	N
.	N
	
Today	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
bake	N
a	N
cake	N
.	N
	
First	N
,	N
I	N
preheated	N
the	N
oven	N
to	N
350	N
degrees	N
.	N
	
Then	N
,	N
I	N
gathered	N
all	N
the	N
ingredients	N
I	N
would	N
need	N
.	N
	
I	N
needed	N
eggs	N
,	N
flour	N
,	N
water	N
,	N
sugar	N
,	N
oil	N
,	N
salt	N
,	N
and	N
baking	N
power	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
a	N
mixing	N
bowl	N
and	N
cracked	N
the	N
eggs	N
into	N
the	N
bowl	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
measured	N
out	N
the	N
water	N
,	N
followed	N
by	N
the	N
oil	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
,	N
I	N
added	N
the	N
dry	N
ingredients	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
spoon	N
and	N
mixed	N
everything	N
together	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
smooth	N
and	N
there	N
were	N
no	N
more	N
lumps	N
.	N
	
That	N
's	N
when	N
the	N
oven	N
beeped	N
to	N
indicate	C
that	N
the	N
oven	N
had	N
reached	N
the	N
correct	N
temperature	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
out	N
a	N
pan	N
and	N
greased	N
the	N
bottom	N
so	N
that	N
the	N
cake	N
would	N
not	N
stick	N
to	N
it	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
poured	N
the	N
mixture	C
from	N
the	N
bowl	N
into	N
the	N
pan	N
.	N
	
Because	N
the	N
oven	N
was	N
ready	N
,	N
I	N
put	N
the	N
pan	N
on	N
a	N
rack	N
in	N
the	N
center	N
of	N
the	N
oven	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
set	N
the	N
timer	N
to	N
35	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
timer	N
went	N
off	N
,	N
I	N
put	N
on	N
some	N
oven	N
mitts	N
and	N
took	N
the	N
cake	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
oven	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
turned	N
off	N
the	N
oven	N
and	N
let	N
the	N
cake	N
cool	N
.	N
	
The	N
church	N
was	N
having	N
a	N
bake	N
sale	C
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
make	N
a	N
pineapple	N
upside	N
down	N
cake	N
,	N
as	N
they	N
are	N
my	N
favorite	N
.	N
	
I	N
realized	N
I	N
needed	N
a	N
few	N
ingredients	N
so	N
I	N
made	N
sure	N
to	N
include	N
them	N
in	N
my	N
shopping	N
list	N
when	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
got	N
home	N
from	N
shopping	N
I	N
gathered	N
all	N
the	N
ingredients	N
and	N
equipment	N
on	N
the	N
counter	C
,	N
opened	N
the	N
cookbook	N
,	N
and	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
oven	N
.	N
	
First	N
I	N
layered	N
the	N
pineapple	N
in	N
the	N
baking	N
dish	N
,	N
placed	N
the	N
cherries	N
in	N
the	N
center	N
of	N
the	N
rings	N
and	N
sprinkled	N
the	N
brown	N
sugar	N
on	N
.	N
	
In	N
the	N
bowl	N
I	N
measured	N
and	N
added	N
all	N
the	N
dry	N
ingredients	N
and	N
mixed	N
them	N
before	N
adding	N
the	N
wet	N
ingredients	N
in	N
the	N
order	N
suggested	N
by	N
the	N
recipe	N
.	N
	
After	N
stirring	N
the	N
appropriate	C
amount	N
of	N
time	N
I	N
carefully	N
poured	N
the	N
batter	N
into	N
the	N
baking	N
dish	N
,	N
over	N
the	N
pineapple	N
.	N
	
I	N
placed	N
the	N
dish	N
in	N
the	N
oven	N
,	N
set	N
the	N
timer	N
,	N
and	N
when	N
the	N
timer	N
rang	N
I	N
checked	N
it	N
then	N
removed	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
it	N
to	N
church	N
in	N
the	N
pan	N
and	N
placed	N
it	N
on	N
a	N
tray	C
there	N
as	N
it	N
was	N
easier	N
to	N
transport	N
that	N
way	N
.	N
	
It	N
looked	N
delicious	N
and	N
sold	N
for	N
more	N
than	N
any	N
of	N
the	N
other	N
cakes	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
bake	N
a	N
chocolate	N
cake	N
yesterday	N
.	N
	
First	N
,	N
I	N
consulted	N
my	N
recipe	N
book	N
and	N
found	C
the	N
recipe	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
use	N
.	N
	
Next	N
,	N
I	N
looked	N
through	N
my	N
kitchen	N
and	N
made	N
sure	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
all	N
the	N
ingredients	N
that	N
I	N
needed	N
for	N
my	N
cake	N
.	N
	
I	N
did	N
have	N
them	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
began	N
to	N
pull	N
them	N
all	N
out	N
.	N
	
I	N
preheated	N
the	N
oven	N
,	N
and	N
greased	N
a	N
cake	N
pan	N
.	N
	
I	N
mixed	N
up	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
ingredients	N
in	N
a	N
big	N
mixing	N
bowl	N
.	N
	
I	N
poured	N
the	N
mixture	C
carefully	N
into	N
the	N
cake	N
pan	N
.	N
	
I	N
carefully	N
placed	N
it	N
into	N
the	N
oven	N
and	N
set	N
the	N
timer	N
according	N
to	N
the	N
recipe	N
.	N
	
While	N
the	N
cake	N
was	N
baking	N
,	N
I	N
cleaned	N
up	N
the	N
mess	N
in	N
the	N
kitchen	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
made	N
chocolate	N
frosting	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
the	N
cake	N
.	N
	
The	N
timer	N
buzzed	N
,	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
cake	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
oven	N
and	N
saw	N
that	N
it	N
was	N
done	N
.	N
	
I	N
set	N
it	N
out	N
to	N
cool	N
.	N
	
Once	N
it	N
was	N
cool	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
the	N
frosting	N
I	N
had	N
just	N
made	N
and	N
frosted	N
the	N
cake	N
.	N
	
The	N
cake	N
was	N
complete	N
and	N
I	N
served	N
it	N
to	N
my	N
family	N
for	N
dessert	N
after	N
dinner	N
that	N
night	N
.	N
	
Just	N
the	N
other	N
day	N
I	N
baked	N
a	N
cake	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
a	N
recipe	N
online	N
for	N
a	N
chocolate	N
cake	N
that	N
I	N
really	N
wanted	N
to	N
try	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
and	N
bought	N
all	N
the	N
ingredients	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
went	N
home	N
and	N
put	N
everything	N
out	N
onto	N
the	N
counter	C
,	N
including	N
my	N
mixing	N
bowls	N
,	N
measuring	N
cups	N
,	N
and	N
baking	N
dish	N
.	N
	
The	N
first	N
thing	N
I	N
did	N
was	N
to	N
mix	N
the	N
flour	N
,	N
water	N
,	N
sugar	N
,	N
butter	N
,	N
eggs	N
and	N
chocolate	N
together	N
in	N
my	N
big	N
mixing	N
bowl	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
greased	N
up	N
my	N
baking	N
dish	N
with	N
oil	N
,	N
so	N
the	N
cake	N
would	N
n't	N
stick	N
to	N
it	N
while	N
it	N
was	N
baking	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
set	N
the	N
oven	N
temperature	N
to	N
350	N
degrees	N
and	N
let	N
it	N
preheat	N
.	N
	
After	N
all	N
my	N
ingredients	N
were	N
in	N
the	N
bowl	N
,	N
I	N
used	N
a	N
big	N
spoon	N
to	N
stir	N
everything	N
together	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
nice	N
and	N
mixed	N
up	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
poured	N
the	N
batter	N
into	N
my	N
baking	N
dish	N
,	N
and	N
put	N
it	N
into	N
the	N
oven	N
.	N
	
I	N
let	N
it	N
bake	N
for	N
an	N
hour	N
,	N
then	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
cake	N
and	N
let	N
it	N
cool	N
.	N
	
After	N
it	N
was	N
cool	N
I	N
put	N
icing	N
on	N
it	N
,	N
and	N
cut	N
it	N
into	N
pieces	N
to	N
save	N
for	N
later	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
cleaned	N
up	N
my	N
huge	N
mess	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
my	N
little	N
sister	N
's	N

I	N
wanted	N
to	N
bake	N
her	N

I	N
found	C

recipe	N
for	N
chocolate	N
cake	N
,	N
which	N
I	N
knew	N
was	N
her	N
favorite	N

I	N
gathered	N
together	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
ingredients	N
along	N
with	N
a	N
bowl	N
and	N
a	N
mixer	N

,	N
eggs	N
,	N
and	N
water	N
and	N
put	N
them	N
into	N
the	N
bowl	N
.	N
	
I	N
used	N
the	N
electric	N
mixer	N
to	N
mix	N
the	N
batter	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
very	N
smooth	N
.	N
	
I	N
greased	N
a	N
cake	N
pan	N
and	N
put	N
a	N
little	N
flour	N
into	N
the	N
bottom	N
and	N
shook	N
it	N
around	N
.	N
	
This	N
would	N
keep	N
the	N
cake	N
from	N
sticking	N
to	N
the	N
pan	N
while	N
it	N
cooked	N
.	N
	
I	N
poured	N
the	N

and	N
placed	N
it	N

the	N
oven	N

While	N
the	N

to	N
make	N
frosting	N

When	N
the	N

I	N
took	N
the	N
cake	N
out	N
of	N
the	N

let	N
it	N

I	N
turned	N

upside	N
down	N
onto	N
a	N
serving	N
platter	N
and	N
put	N
the	N
frosting	N
on	N

I	N
used	N
a	N
special	N

I	N

this	N
year	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
do	N
something	N
different	N

I	N
was	N
n't	N
too	N
sure	N
how	N
to	N
make	N
a	N

I	N
decided	N
to	N

The	N
day	N

n't	N
have	N
anything	N
you	N
'd	N
like	N
to	N
drink	N
or	N
eat	N
on	N
the	N
flight	N
.	N
	
You	N
should	N
also	N
stop	N
at	N
the	N
restroom	N
so	N
,	N
hopefully	N
,	N
you	N
wo	N
n't	N
have	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
bathroom	N
during	N
the	N
flight	N
.	N
	
If	N
you	N
have	N
an	N
assigned	N
seat	N
for	N
your	N
flight	N
do	N
n't	N
rush	C
to	N
get	N
on	N
because	N
it	N
'll	N
just	N
mean	N
sitting	N
there	N
for	N
a	N
longer	N
period	N
of	N
time	N
.	N
	
Once	N
you	N
are	N
ready	N
to	N
board	N
just	N
be	N
patient	N
with	N
everyone	N
else	N
who	N
is	N
flying	N
and	N
with	N
the	N
flight	N
attendants	N
.	N
	
Once	N
you	N
have	N
found	C
your	N
seat	N
store	N
any	N
large	N
items	N
overhead	N
and	N
keep	N
whatever	N
you	N
might	N
want	N
during	N
the	N
flight	N
in	N
the	N
seat-back	N
.	N
	
I	N
suggest	N
putting	N
your	N
electronic	N
devices	N
there	N
,	N
headphones	N
,	N
books	N
etc	N
.	N
	
.	N
	
I	N
also	N
like	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
to	N
have	N
gum	C
,	N
my	N
snack	N
and	N
my	N
water	N
readily	C
available	N
.	N
	
If	N
you	N
have	N
a	N
smaller	N
item	N
you	N
can	N
put	N
that	N
underneath	N
the	N
seat	N
in	N
front	N
of	N
you	N
.	N
	
It	N
is	N
a	N
good	N
idea	N
to	N
chew	C
gum	C
at	N
least	N
at	N
the	N
start	N
of	N
the	N
flight	N
so	N
you	N
avoid	N
having	N
your	N
ears	N
pop	N
.	N
	
Try	N
to	N
stay	N
hydrated	N
during	N
your	N
flight	N
,	N
and	N
keep	N
your	N
seat-belt	N
on	N
whenever	N
you	N
are	N
sitting	N
down	N
.	N
	
Last	N
week	N
,	N
I	N
flew	N
in	N
an	N
airplane	N
to	N
visit	N
a	N
different	N
state	C
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
parked	N
my	N
car	N
in	N
the	N
parking	N
lot	N
,	N
I	N
found	C
the	N
right	N
ticket	N
counter	C
for	N
my	N
airline	N
and	N
then	N
turned	N
in	N
my	N
suitcase	N
so	N
it	N
could	N
travel	N
in	N
the	N
cargo	C
of	N
the	N
plane	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
a	N
place	N
called	N
a	N
gate	N
which	N
is	N
really	N
just	N
an	N
indoor	N
place	N
to	N
wait	N
for	N
my	N
plane	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N
	
It	N
has	N
a	N
big	N
window	N
where	N
I	N
watched	N
the	N
planes	N
and	N
waited	N
for	N
my	N
turn	N
to	N
get	N
on	N
one	N
.	N
	
Once	N
my	N
plane	N
arrived	N
,	N
a	N
nice	N
flight	N
attendant	N
showed	N
me	N
to	N
my	N
seat	N
and	N
I	N
sat	N
down	N
to	N
wait	N
.	N
	
My	N
seat	N
was	N
comfortable	N
,	N
but	N
small	N
,	N
and	N
there	N
were	N
people	N
sitting	N
on	N
each	N
side	N
of	N
me	N
.	N
	
Once	N
everyone	N
settled	N
in	N
,	N
the	N
plane	N
started	N
and	N
then	N
drove	N
down	N
the	N
runway	C
to	N
wait	N
its	N
turn	N
to	N
take	N
off	N
.	N
	
When	N
we	N
took	N
off	N
,	N
it	N
rose	N
into	N
the	N
air	N
and	N
then	N
leveled	N
off	N
to	N
what	N
the	N
pilot	N
called	N
cruising	N
speed	N
.	N
	
Then	N
the	N
flight	N
attendants	N
brought	N
around	N
food	N
and	N
drinks	N
.	N
	
The	N
plane	N
was	N
a	N
little	N
noisy	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
was	N
fun	N
to	N
watch	N
the	N
people	N
and	N
the	N
food	N
was	N
pretty	N
good	N
.	N
	
The	N
plane	N
ride	N
was	N
short	N
and	N
we	N
had	N
barely	C
finished	N
our	N
food	N
and	N
drinks	N
before	N
the	N
pilot	N
said	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
to	N
land	N
in	N
the	N
next	N
town	N
.	N
	
The	N
flight	N
attendants	N
came	N
back	N
around	N
to	N
pick	N
up	N
our	N
trash	C
and	N
then	N
we	N
had	N
to	N
buckle	N
our	N
seat	N
belts	N
again	N
for	N
the	N
plane	N
to	N
land	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
fun	N
trip	N
and	N
I	N
hope	N
I	N
get	N
to	N
do	N
it	N
again	N
sometime	N
.	N
	
A	N
month	N
ago	N
,	N
I	N
bought	N
a	N
plane	N
ticket	N
online	N
.	N
	
I	N
chose	N
a	N
round-trip	N
ticket	N
and	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
pick	N
a	N
window	N
seat	N
.	N
	
The	N
day	N
of	N
my	N
flight	N
,	N
I	N
arrived	N
at	N
the	N
airport	N
2	N
hours	N
early	N
to	N
be	N
able	C
to	N
check	N
in	N
and	N
go	N
through	N
security	N
with	N
plenty	N
of	N
time	N
to	N
spare	N
to	N
make	N
my	N
flight	N
on	N
time	N
.	N
	
I	N
boarded	N
the	N
plane	N
.	N
	
I	N
placed	N
my	N
baggage	N
in	N
the	N
overhead	N
bin	N
and	N
took	N
my	N
seat	N
near	N
the	N
window	N
.	N
	
Two	N
people	N
sat	N
next	N
to	N
me	N
,	N
filling	N
out	N
the	N
row	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
on	N
my	N
seat	N
belt	N
.	N
	
The	N
stewardess	N
informed	N
everyone	N
about	N
safety	C
precautions	N
.	N
	
Everyone	N
put	N
their	N
seats	N
in	N
the	N
upright	C
position	N
and	N
locked	N
up	N
their	N
tray	C
tables	N
.	N
	
The	N
pilot	N
spoke	N
to	N
us	N
over	N
the	N
intercom	N
,	N
telling	N
us	N
to	N
sit	N
back	N
and	N
relax	N
,	N
and	N
that	N
we	N
will	N
reach	N
our	N
destination	N
in	N
a	N
short	N
time	N
.	N
	
The	N
plane	N
rumbled	N
to	N
life	N
,	N
sped	N
forward	N
,	N
and	N
off	N
we	N
soared	N
into	N
the	N
sky	N
.	N
	
My	N
ears	N
popped	N
from	N
the	N
change	N
in	N
air	N
pressure	C
but	N
it	N
only	N
took	N
a	N
few	N
moments	N
for	N
my	N
body	N
to	N
acclimate	N
itself	N
to	N
its	N
new	N
,	N
airborne	N
environment	C
.	N
	
The	N
stewardess	N
served	N
the	N
passengers	N
drinks	N
and	N
peanuts	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
a	N
nap	C
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
awoke	N
,	N
we	N
were	N
landing	C
.	N
	
We	N
were	N
told	N
to	N
put	N
our	N
seats	N
back	N
in	N
the	N
upright	C
position	N
and	N
to	N
lock	N
back	N
up	N
our	N
tray	C
tables	N
.	N
	
We	N
glided	N
to	N
the	N
ground	N
and	N
landed	N
with	N
a	N
bit	N
of	N
a	N
bump	C
and	N
jolt	N
.	N
	
The	N
plane	N
pulled	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
gate	N
and	N
we	N
were	N
let	N
off	N
.	N
	
Wow	N
!	N
I	N
got	N
to	N
fly	N
on	N
an	N
airplane	N
to	N
go	N
see	N
my	N
uncle	N
!	N
I	N
called	N
the	N
airline	N
in	N
advance	C
and	N
purchased	N
a	N
ticket	N

On	N
the	N
day	N
I	N
was	N
flying	N
to	N
see	N
him	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
to	N
the	N
airport	N
2	N
hours	N
early	N
.	N
	
I	N
checked	N
in	N
at	N
a	N
big	N
desk	N
where	N
they	N
give	N
me	N
my	N
ticket	N
,	N
weighed	N
my	N
suitcase	N
,	N
and	N
put	N
my	N
suitcase	N
on	N
a	N
big	N
conveyor	N
belt	N
to	N
take	N
it	N
to	N
my	N
plane	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
over	N
to	N
a	N
big	N
line	N
of	N
people	N
and	N
waited	N
my	N
turn	N
to	N
go	N
through	N
security	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
was	N
safely	N
through	N
,	N
I	N
waited	N
until	N
they	N
called	N
my	N
seat	N
number	N
and	N
I	N
boarded	N
the	N
plane	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
my	N
seat	N
in	N
my	N
row	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
a	N
window	N
seat	N
!	N
We	N
all	N
fastened	N
our	N
seat	N
belts	N
and	N
listened	N
to	N
the	N
flight	N
attendants	N
give	N
us	N
safety	C
information	N
about	N
flying	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
short	N
flight	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
flight	N
attendants	N
still	N
brought	N
us	N
snacks	N
and	N
drinks	N
on	N
a	N
little	N
cart	N
that	N
they	N
rolled	N
down	N
the	N
aisle	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
plane	N
landed	N
,	N
we	N
all	N
lined	N
up	N
and	N
walked	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
plane	N
door	N
.	N
	
The	N
pilot	N
was	N
there	N
waving	N
goodbye	N
to	N
us	N
all	N
!	N
I	N
was	N
a	N
little	N
nervous	N
about	N
my	N
plane	N
trip	N
,	N
but	N
my	N
friend	N
was	N
coming	N
with	N
me	N
,	N
and	N
that	N
made	N
me	N
feel	N
a	N
little	N
better	N
.	N
	
We	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
airport	N
,	N
and	N
gave	N
our	N
bags	N
to	N
an	N
attendant	N
to	N
be	N
checked	N
onto	N
the	N
plane	N
.	N
	
We	N
went	N
through	N
the	N
security	N
station	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
everything	N
was	N
safe	N
,	N
then	N
we	N
were	N
ready	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
our	N
terminal	C
.	N
	
We	N
were	N
there	N
a	N
little	N
early	N
,	N
so	N
we	N
grabbed	N
a	N
bite	N
to	N
eat	N
at	N
the	N
restaurant	N
while	N
we	N
waited	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
plane	N
arrived	N
,	N
we	N
gave	N
the	N
attendant	N
our	N
tickets	N
and	N
got	N
on	N
the	N
plane	N
.	N
	
Once	N
we	N
were	N
all	N
seated	N
,	N
the	N
flight	N
attendant	N
went	N
over	N
some	N
safety	C
rules	N
with	N
us	N
before	N
we	N
took	N
off	N
.	N
	
I	N
watched	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
as	N
we	N
got	N
higher	N
and	N
higher	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
little	N
scary	N
,	N
but	N
kind	N
of	N
fun	N
,	N
too	N
.	N
	
The	N
flight	N
attendant	N
came	N
by	N
and	N
gave	N
us	N
all	N
a	N
little	N
snack	N
during	N
the	N
flight	N
.	N
	
By	N
the	N
time	N
we	N
landed	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
n't	N
scared	N
anymore	N
.	N
	
We	N
went	N
to	N
get	N
our	N
bags	N
from	N
the	N
big	N
conveyer	N
belt	N
and	N
were	N
soon	N
on	N
our	N
way	N
from	N
the	N
airport	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
a	N
trip	N
to	N
the	N
beach	N
by	N
plane	N
.	N
	
I	N
arrived	N
at	N
the	N
airport	N
early	N
to	N
go	N
through	N
the	N
checkout	N
process	C
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
not	N
to	N
check	N
any	N
bags	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
simply	C
got	N
my	N
ticket	N
and	N
then	N
went	N
through	N
the	N
security	N
line	N
.	N
	
After	N
security	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
my	N
terminal	C
to	N
wait	N
for	N
the	N
plane	N
to	N
board	N
.	N
	
Once	N
we	N
went	N
through	N
the	N
boarding	N
procedure	C
I	N
sat	N
at	N
my	N
seat	N
next	N
to	N
the	N
window	N
.	N
	
Beside	N
me	N
was	N
an	N
older	N
lady	N
who	N
made	N
small	N
talk	N
with	N
me	N
until	N
the	N
plane	N
took	N
off	N
-LRB-	N
even	N
talking	N
through	N
the	N
safety	C
speech	N
given	N
by	N
the	N
flight	N
attendants	N
before	N
we	N
took	N
off	N
-RRB-	N
.	N
	
She	N
quickly	N
fell	N
asleep	N
once	N
we	N
were	N
in	N
the	N
air	N
though	N
.	N
	
I	N
observed	N
the	N
land	N
below	N
and	N
the	N
clouds	N
for	N
awhile	N
before	N
I	N
too	N
fell	N
asleep	N
.	N
	
I	N
awoke	N
to	N
the	N
sound	N
of	N
the	N
flight	N
attendant	N
informing	N
us	N
the	N
plane	N
would	N
soon	N
be	N
landing	C
.	N
	
I	N
almost	N
barfed	N
as	N
we	N
made	N
our	N
decent	C
,	N
but	N
managed	N
to	N
hold	N
it	N
in	N
.	N
	
Once	N
we	N
landed	N
I	N
departed	N
the	N
plane	N
with	N
the	N
other	N
passengers	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
so	N
excited	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
my	N
first	N
trip	N
to	N
Florida	N
by	N
airplane	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
to	N
buy	N
a	N
window	N
seat	N
so	N
I	N
could	N
see	N
the	N
beautiful	N
view	N
from	N
high	N
up	N
in	N
the	N
sky	N
.	N
	
I	N
listened	N
carefully	N
to	N
the	N
flight	N
attendant	N
as	N
she	N
gave	N
her	N
speech	N
about	N
safety	C
precautions	N
.	N
	
After	N
she	N
finished	N
the	N
pilot	N
got	N
on	N
the	N
loud	N
speaker	N
and	N
informed	N
us	N
that	N
we	N
will	N
be	N
taking	N
off	N
shortly	C
.	N
	
He	N
told	N
us	N
what	N
time	N
we	N
will	N
be	N
landing	C
in	N
Florida	N
and	N
even	N
the	N
temperature	N
it	N
will	N
be	N
when	N
we	N
landed	N
.	N
	
He	N
then	N
told	N
us	N
to	N
buckle	N
our	N
seat	N
belt	N
and	N
turn	N
off	N
any	N
electronic	N
devices	N
we	N
may	N
have	N
with	N
us	N
.	N
	
A	N
couple	N
minutes	N
later	N
the	N
engine	N
came	N
to	N
life	N
and	N
the	N
plane	N
started	N
moving	C
towards	N
the	N
runway	C
.	N
	
When	N
it	N
reach	N
the	N
runway	C
it	N
started	N
to	N
speed	N
up	N
very	N
fast	N
and	N
after	N
a	N
minute	N
I	N
felt	N
the	N
plane	N
lift	N
off	N
of	N
the	N
ground	N
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
and	N
saw	N
us	N
leaving	N
the	N
ground	N
.	N
	
When	N
we	N
reach	N
our	N
cruising	N
altitude	N
the	N
pilot	N
informed	N
us	N
it	N
was	N
now	N
safe	N
for	N
us	N
to	N
take	N
off	N
our	N
seat	N
belts	N
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
and	N
found	C
myself	N
amazed	N
as	N
we	N
soared	N
over	N
the	N
clouds	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
couple	N
days	C
from	N
ordering	N
the	N
plane	N
tickets	N
online	N
.	N
	
I	N
drove	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
airport	N
which	N
took	N
about	N
45	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
Upon	C
arriving	N
there	N
I	N
parked	N
my	N
car	N
and	N
walked	N
inside	N
the	N
airport	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
to	N
go	N
through	N
security	N
first	N
which	N
checked	N
everything	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
walked	N
to	N
find	N
the	N
wing	N
where	N
my	N
assigned	N
airplane	N
was	N
at	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
found	C
it	N
,	N
I	N
drop	N
off	N
my	N
luggage	N
and	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
clerk	N
with	N
my	N
plane	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
After	N
she	N
inspects	N
it	N
,	N
I	N
go	N
on	N
the	N
airplane	N
and	N
sit	N
onto	N
my	N
assigned	N
seat	N
.	N
	
Since	N
this	N
was	N
my	N
first	N
ride	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
not	N
sit	N
near	N
the	N
window	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
prevent	N
getting	N
sick	N
.	N
	
After	N
the	N
plane	N
filled	N
up	N
with	N
more	N
people	N
,	N
we	N
ended	N
up	N
taking	N
off	N
.	N
	
During	N
the	N
ride	N
everyone	N
was	N
very	N
quite	N
and	N
there	N
was	N
a	N
movie	N
playing	N
during	N
the	N
ride	N
.	N
	
After	N
2	N
hours	N
the	N
plane	N
arrived	N
to	N
the	N
next	N
airport	N
and	N
I	N
got	N
off	N
.	N
	
I	N
picked	N
up	N
my	N
luggage	N
,	N
and	N
met	N
up	N
with	N
my	N
friend	N
who	N
met	N
me	N
there	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
I	N
had	N
my	N
ticket	N
in	N
advance	C
and	N
checked	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
my	N
flight	N
was	N
not	N
canceled	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
pre-packed	N
what	N
I	N
needed	N
and	N
doubled	N
checked	N
the	N
list	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
that	N
all	N
my	N
items	N
were	N
approved	N
.	N
	
Then	N
,	N
I	N
arrived	N
at	N
the	N
airport	N
about	N
one	N
and	N
a	N
half	N
hours	N
early	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
to	N
go	N
through	N
security	N
first	N
,	N
since	N
there	N
were	N
long	N
lines	N
for	N
that	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
to	N
take	N
off	N
my	N
shoes	N
and	N
put	N
my	N
bags	N
through	N
an	N
x-ray	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
was	N
done	N
,	N
I	N
put	N
my	N
luggage	N
in	N
the	N
correct	N
area	N
so	N
it	N
could	N
be	N
loaded	N
on	N
the	N
plane	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
until	N
my	N
plane	N
was	N
ready	N
to	N
board	N
and	N
showed	N
the	N
flight	N
attendant	N
my	N
boarding	N
pass	N
.	N
	
I	N
stayed	N
quietly	N
on	N
the	N
plane	N
and	N
made	N
sure	N
I	N
was	N
in	N
my	N
assigned	N
seat	N
.	N
	
It	N
can	N
be	N
crowded	N
and	N
boring	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
read	N
my	N
book	N
on	N
the	N
flight	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
to	N
listen	N
to	N
the	N
flight	N
attendants	N
when	N
they	N
had	N
an	N
announcement	N
to	N
make	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
in	N
a	N
seating	N
area	N
near	N
the	N
gate	N
at	N
the	N
airport	N
.	N
	
I	N
could	N
see	N
the	N
huge	N
jetliner	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
at	N
my	N
ticket	N
and	N
saw	N
that	N
I	N
was	N
in	N
Group	N
3	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
gate	N
attendant	N
called	N
my	N
number	N
I	N
showed	N
her	N
my	N
ticket	N
and	N
boarded	N
the	N
plane	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
my	N
seat	N
,	N
22D	N
,	N
and	N
sat	N
down	N
,	N
putting	N
the	N
small	N
bag	N
I	N
had	N
packed	C
under	N
the	N
seat	N
in	N
front	N
of	N
me	N
.	N
	
After	N
everyone	N
was	N
on	N
the	N
plane	N
they	N
shut	N
the	N
door	N
.	N
	
The	N
flight	N
attendant	N
made	N
a	N
few	N
announcements	N
and	N
I	N
buckled	N
myself	N
in	N
.	N
	
The	N
plane	N
pulled	N
away	N
from	N
the	N
gate	N
and	N
taxied	N
to	N
a	N
runway	C
.	N
	
We	N
sat	N
on	N
the	N
runway	C
for	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
before	N
we	N
were	N
given	N
approval	C
to	N
take	N
off	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
pushed	N
back	N
in	N
my	N
seat	N
and	N
we	N
accelerated	N
down	N
the	N
runway	C
.	N
	
The	N
nose	N
lifted	N
and	N
we	N
were	N
in	N
the	N
air	N
.	N
	
During	N
the	N
flight	N
I	N
got	N
a	N
drink	N
.	N
	
One	N
hour	N
later	N
,	N
the	N
plane	N
set	N
down	N
in	N
Cleveland	N

Success	N
!	N
Five	N
years	N
ago	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
New	N
York	N
City	N
.	N
	
I	N
live	N
in	N
Missouri	N
,	N
so	N
New	N
York	N
City	N
is	N
very	N
far	N
away	N
from	N
me	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
buy	N
plain	N
tickets	N
so	N
I	N
could	N
ride	N
in	N
an	N
airplane	N
to	N
get	N
there	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
never	N
ridden	N
on	N
an	N
airplane	N
before	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
was	N
a	N
little	N
bit	N
nervous	N
.	N
	
I	N
ordered	N
my	N
plane	N
tickets	N
online	N
.	N
	
My	N
sister	N
drove	N
me	N
to	N
the	N
airport	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
got	N
there	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
counter	C
to	N
check	N
my	N
luggage	N
.	N
	
The	N
lady	N
working	N
at	N
the	N
counter	C
was	N
very	N
nice	N
and	N
told	N
me	N
where	N
to	N
go	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
through	N
a	N
metal	N
detector	N
that	N
security	N
guards	N
were	N
monitoring	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
my	N
airplane	N
terminal	C
,	N
and	N
I	N
patiently	C
waited	N
while	N
sitting	N
in	N
a	N
chair	N
.	N
	
Over	N
the	N
speakers	N
,	N
a	N
voice	N
told	N
passengers	N
we	N
could	N
begin	N
boarding	N
the	N
plane	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
onto	N
the	N
plane	N
and	N
the	N
ride	N
took	N
about	N
three	N
hours	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
pretty	N
simple	N
experience	N
.	N
	
My	N
wife	N
and	N
I	N
were	N
flying	N
to	N
New	N
York	N
City	N
for	N
a	N
vacation	N
.	N
	
We	N
both	N
like	N
to	N
fly	N
.	N
	
After	N
going	N
through	N
the	N
preliminaries	N
and	N
waiting	N
in	N
the	N
lounge	C
,	N
we	N
were	N
soon	N
stepping	N
onto	N
the	N
plane	N
and	N
trying	N
to	N
find	N
our	N
seats	N
.	N
	
Planes	N
can	N
be	N
crowded	N
when	N
one	N
is	N
getting	N
on	N
or	N
off	N
,	N
but	N
we	N
found	C
our	N
seats	N
and	N
buckled	N
in	N
.	N
	
It	N
took	N
a	N
bit	N
of	N
time	N
for	N
everyone	N
to	N
settle	C
in	N
,	N
but	N
before	N
long	N
the	N
plane	N
was	N
taxiing	N
down	N
the	N
runway	C
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
plane	N
lifted	N
off	N
,	N
I	N
could	N
feel	N
it	N
tilt	N
to	N
one	N
side	N
and	N
then	N
right	N
itself	N
again	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
fun	N
looking	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
window	N
and	N
seeing	N
the	N
world	N
below	N
get	N
smaller	N
and	N
smaller	N
,	N
then	N
disappear	N
as	N
we	N
climbed	N
above	N
the	N
clouds	N
.	N
	
We	N
both	N
enjoyed	N
the	N
plane	N
ride	N
a	N
great	N
deal	C
.	N
	
A	N
flight	N
attendant	N
offered	N
us	N
drinks	N
and	N
snacks	N
,	N
and	N
we	N
had	N
some	N
orange	N
soda	N
and	N
complimentary	C
peanuts	N
.	N
	
Soon	N
the	N
flight	N
was	N
over	N
,	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
to	N
disembark	N
.	N
	
We	N
had	N
enjoyed	N
the	N
airplane	N
ride	N
.	N
	
I	N
flew	N
on	N
an	N

about	N
2	N
months	N

It	N
was	N
a	N
very	N
early	N

My	N
brother	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
drop	N
me	N
off	N
at	N
the	N
airport	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
already	N
checked	N
in	N
online	N
the	N
night	N
before	N
and	N
had	N
no	N
bags	N
to	N
check	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
walked	N
straight	N
to	N
the	N
security	N
line	N
.	N
	
Once	N
TSA	N
checked	N
my	N
ID	N
and	N
boarding	N
pass	N
,	N
I	N
stood	N
in	N
line	N
for	N
about	N
10	N
minutes	N
while	N
I	N
waited	N
for	N
my	N
bags\/body	N
to	N
be	N
scanned	N
.	N
	
Once	N
through	N
security	N
,	N
I	N
checked	N
the	N
monitors	N
to	N
see	N
that	N
my	N
flight	N
was	N
on	N
time	N
and	N
that	N
there	N
was	N
not	N

I	N
then	N

to	N

and	N
boarded	N
the	N

about	N
10	N
minutes	N

The	N

went	N
over	N
the	N
safety	C
procedures	N
,	N
the	N
captain	N
gave	N
his	N
greetings	N
,	N
and	N
we	N
were	N
on	N
our	N
way	N
.	N
	
The	N
flight	N
was	N
very	N
smooth	N
and	N
quiet	N

The	N
time	N
flew	N
by	N
,	N
as	N
I	N
slept	N
most	N
of	N
the	N

I	N

and	N
booked	N
myself	N
a	N

from	N
my	N

As	N

needed	N
into	N
a	N
carry	N
on	N

and	N
headed	N
to	N

Today	N

As	N

then	N
had	N
me	N

last	N
summer	N

We	N
decided	N
the	N
best	N
way	N

would	N
be	N
an	N
airplane	N

We	N

a	N
half	N
early	N
.	N
	
There	N
are	N
many	N
delays	N
before	N
you	N
actually	N
get	N
on	N
board	N
an	N
airplane	N
.	N
	
First	N
,	N
,	N
you	N
have	N
to	N
go	N
through	N
a	N
metal	N
detector	N
and	N
wait	N
in	N
long	N
lines	N
just	N
to	N
get	N
to	N
the	N
metal	N
detectors	N
.	N
	
Then	N
you	N
have	N
to	N
check	N
your	N
luggage	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
,	N
you	N
have	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
terminal	C
and	N
provide	N
proof	C
of	N
a	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
Once	N
you	N
get	N
on	N
an	N
airplane	N
,	N
you	N
have	N
to	N
prepare	N
for	N
turbulence	N
.	N
	
Other	N
than	N
that	N
,	N
flying	N
on	N
an	N
airplane	N
is	N
a	N
safe	N
and	N
efficient	N
way	N
to	N
travel	N
.	N
	
When	N
we	N
landed	N
,	N
we	N
went	N
straight	N
to	N
the	N
beach	N
.	N
	
I	N
love	N
to	N
travel	N
the	N
USA	N
,	N
and	N
recently	N
,	N
the	N
world	N
.	N
	
Without	N
the	N
advent	N
of	N
the	N
modern	N
airplane	N
this	N
would	N
be	N
both	N
very	N
time	N
consuming	N
and	N
very	N
expensive	N
.	N
	
To	N
save	N
money	N
,	N
I	N
like	N
to	N
research	N
fares	N
by	N
time	N
and	N
location	N
.	N
	
We	N
live	N
in	N
a	N
small	N
city	N
so	N
many	N
times	C
we	N
can	N
drive	N
a	N
few	N
hours	N
and	N
save	N
a	N
lot	N
of	N
money	N
by	N
flying	N
out	N
of	N
that	N
airport	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
get	N
to	N
the	N
airport	N
,	N
I	N
check	N
my	N
bags	N
and	N
go	N
through	N
security	N
.	N
	
After	N
passing	N
through	N
security	N
,	N
I	N
like	N
to	N
check	N
my	N
email	N
,	N
talk	N
to	N
family	N
and	N
friends	N
,	N
and	N
do	N
some	N
reading	N
over	N
a	N
cup	N
of	N
coffee	N
.	N
	
Then	N
we	N
shut	N
down	N
the	N
phone	N
and	N
get	N
on	N
the	N
plane	N
.	N
	
I	N
love	N
the	N
window	N
seat	N
and	N
enjoy	N
watching	N
the	N
clouds	N
and	N
the	N
ground	N
below	N
us	N
as	N
we	N
are	N
flying	N
to	N
the	N
destination	N
.	N
	
Upon	C
landing	C
I	N
head	N
out	N
to	N
the	N
next	N
destination	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
headed	N
to	N
visit	N
my	N
cousin	N
in	N
Italy	N
for	N
a	N
few	N
weeks	N
.	N
	
The	N
week	N
before	N
,	N
my	N
dad	N
went	N
online	N
and	N
purchased	N
me	N
one	N
of	N
those	N
convenient	N
e-tickets	N
.	N
	
He	N
printed	N
it	N
out	N
and	N
made	N
sure	N
I	N
remembered	N
to	N
bring	N
it	N
on	N
the	N
day	N
of	N
my	N
flight	N
.	N
	
We	N
arrived	N
early	N
to	N
the	N
airport	N
so	N
that	N
i	N
could	N
go	N
through	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
security	N
checks	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
to	N
take	N
off	N
my	N
shoes	N
and	N
put	N
my	N
belongings	C
in	N
a	N
tray	C
as	N
I	N
went	N
through	N
the	N
scanner	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
,	N
I	N
saw	N
the	N
board	N
with	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
flights	N
and	N
saw	N
that	N
my	N
flight	N
was	N
leaving	N
soon	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
by	N
the	N
gate	N
with	N
my	N
parents	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
to	N
board	N
.	N
	
Many	N
passengers	N
climbed	N
aboard	C
and	N
found	C
their	N
seats	N
.	N
	
The	N
captain	N
greeted	N
us	N
over	N
the	N
loudspeaker	N
and	N
then	N
the	N
plane	N
took	N
off	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
tired	N
so	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
nap	C
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
woke	N
up	N
I	N
could	N
see	N
the	N
clouds	N
around	N
me	N
as	N
we	N
were	N
pretty	N
high	N
up	N
in	N
the	N
air	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
few	N
more	N
hours	N
we	N
arrived	N
and	N
everyone	N
clapped	N
.	N
	
I	N
arrived	N
at	N
the	N
airport	N
with	N
my	N
luggage	N
,	N
identification	N
,	N
boarding	N
pass	N
,	N
and	N
some	N
spare	N
cash	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
front	N
desk	N
and	N
asked	N
if	N
my	N
flight	N
was	N
currently	C
on	N
time	N
,	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
in	N
the	N
lobby	C
for	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
until	N
they	N
announced	N
that	N
the	N
plane	N
was	N
now	N
boarding	N
for	N
my	N
flight	N
to	N
California	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
up	N
with	N
my	N
luggage	N
and	N
belongings	C
and	N
walked	N
towards	N
the	N
terminal	C
.	N
	
A	N
worker	N
scanned	N
my	N
boarding	N
pass	N
with	N
a	N
special	N
scanner	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
then	N
took	N
off	N
my	N
shoes	N
and	N
set	N
them	N
in	N
a	N
bin	N
that	N
a	N
worker	N
handed	N
me	N
,	N
along	N
with	N
my	N
carry-on	N
luggage	N
.	N
	
I	N
set	N
my	N
big	N
suitcase	N
onto	N
a	N
cart	N
where	N
it	N
would	N
be	N
taken	N
onto	N
the	N
plane	N
as	N
cargo	C
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
through	N
a	N
body	N
scanner	N
manned	N
by	N
security	N
guards	N
and	N
passed	N
through	N
it	N
without	N
a	N
problem	N
.	N
	
Then	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
my	N
carry-on	N
luggage	N
and	N
shoes	N
back	N
and	N
put	N
them	N
on	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
through	N
a	N
tunnel	N
onto	N
the	N
airplane	N
and	N
sat	N
down	N
.	N
	
I	N
listened	N
to	N
the	N
instructions	N
that	N
were	N
said	N
over	N
a	N
speaker	N
and	N
the	N
plane	N
took	N
off	N
after	N
a	N
long	N
wait	N
.	N
	
Then	N
,	N
I	N
listened	N
to	N
music	N
on	N
my	N
smartphone	N
and	N
fell	N
asleep	N
for	N
the	N
full	N
four	N
hour	N
flight	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
woke	N
up	N
,	N
the	N
plane	N
was	N
landing	C
and	N
I	N
looked	N
out	N
my	N
window	N

saw	N
California	N
.	N
	
We	N
had	N
made	N
it	N
safely	N
to	N
our	N
destination	N

Flying	N
in	N
an	N

is	N
always	N
exciting	N
.	N
	
The	N

before	N

I	N

Last	N
night	N
,	N
I	N
made	N
a	N
grocery	N
list	N
and	N
went	N
shopping	N
.	N
	
To	N
make	N
a	N
list	N
,	N
I	N
go	N
through	N
my	N
cabinets	N
and	N
refrigerator	N
and	N
write	N
down	N
things	N
that	N
I	N
am	N
out	N
of	N
.	N
	
These	N
are	N
always	N
the	N
same	N
things	N
like	N
coffee	N
and	N
milk	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
thought	N
of	N
some	N
recipes	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
make	N
.	N
	
I	N
wrote	N
down	N
pasta	N
shells	N
,	N
ricotta	N
cheese	N
,	N
Parmesan	N
cheese	N
,	N
spinach	N
,	N
and	N

sauce	N
.	N
	
I	N
am	N
going	N
to	N
make	N
stuffed	N
shells	N
this	N
week	N
!	N
When	N
I	N
got	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
my	N
reusable	N
bags	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
car	N
.	N
	
Using	N
no	N
plastic	N
bags	N
is	N
a	N
great	N
way	N
to	N
help	N
the	N
environment	C
.	N
	
Since	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
around	N
8	N
p.m	N
.	N
	
,	N
it	N
was	N
n't	N
very	N
crowded	N
.	N
	
I	N
could	N
relax	N
as	N
I	N
moved	N
my	N
way	N
from	N
produce	N
,	N
dry	N
goods	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
dairy	C
.	N
	
I	N
saw	N
a	N
huge	N
display	N
of	N
Easter	N
candy	N
because	N
it	N
is	N
March	C
and	N
the	N
holiday	N
is	N
coming	N
up	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
so	N
tempted	N
to	N
buy	N
a	N
lot	N
of	N
chocolate	N
but	N
I	N
did	N
n't	N
.	N
	
I	N
only	N
try	N
to	N
get	N
treats	N
once	N
in	N
awhile	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
front	N
check	N
out	N
.	N
	
The	N
cashier	N
was	N
nice	N
and	N
the	N
bagger	N
was	N
happy	N
to	N
use	N
my	N
own	N
bags	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
home	N
and	N
put	N
everything	N
away	N
.	N
	
Now	N
I	N
ca	N
n't	N
wait	N
to	N
make	N
my	N
stuffed	N
shells	N
for	N
dinner	N
!	N
I	N
was	N
hosting	N
a	N
party	N
and	N
needed	N
to	N
pick	N
up	N
some	N
groceries	N
for	N
my	N
guests	N
.	N
	
I	N
started	N
by	N
making	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
all	N
the	N
food	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
buy	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
grabbed	N
my	N
reusable	N
shopping	N
bags	N
and	N
drove	N
to	N
the	N
grocery	N
store	N
.	N
	
I	N
chose	N
a	N
cart	N
from	N
outside	N
and	N
picked	N
up	N
a	N
copy	N
of	N
the	N
grocery	N
store	N
ad	N
from	N
the	N
front	N
of	N
the	N
store	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
through	N
all	N
the	N
aisles	N
pushing	N
my	N
cart	N
.	N
	
I	N
picked	N
out	N
the	N
food	N
I	N
needed	N
from	N
my	N
list	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
to	N
choose	N
food	N
that	N
was	N
on	N
sale	C
or	N
generic	N
food	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
had	N
checked	N
everything	N
off	N
on	N
my	N
list	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
in	N
line	N
at	N
the	N
store	N
checkouts	N
.	N
	
There	N
was	N
a	N
friendly	N
cashier	N
who	N
scanned	N
all	N
of	N
my	N
groceries	N
and	N
told	N
me	N
how	N
much	N
money	N
it	N
cost	N
.	N
	
There	N
was	N
also	N
a	N
friendly	N
bagger	N
who	N
put	N
all	N
on	N
my	N
groceries	N
in	N
my	N
bags	N
.	N
	
At	N
the	N
end	N
,	N
the	N
bagger	N
offered	N
to	N
help	N
put	N
all	N
of	N
my	N
groceries	N
in	N
the	N
cart	N
.	N
	
As	N
I	N
left	N
the	N
parking	N
lot	N
,	N
I	N
waved	N
goodbye	N
to	N
him	N
after	N
my	N
successful	N
trip	N
.	N
	
Last	N
Friday	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
grocery	N
shopping	N
as	N
I	N
do	N
every	N
Friday	N
.	N
	
The	N
first	N
thing	N
I	N
did	N
was	N
looked	N
around	N
the	N
house	N
to	N
see	N
what	N
all	N
I	N
needed	N
from	N
the	N
grocery	N
store	N
.	N
	
I	N
always	N
make	N
a	N
list	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
I	N
do	N
n't	N
forget	N
anything	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
grocery	N
store	N
about	N
lunch	N
time	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
got	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
,	N
I	N
made	N
sure	N

had	N
my	N
list	N

money	N
and	N
got	N
out	N
of	N
my	N
car	N

I	N
went	N
in	N
and	N
got	N
a	N
buggy	N
.	N
	
As	N
I	N
went	N
through	N
the	N
store	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
things	N

my	N
list	N

with	N
,	N
like	N

When	N
I	N
was	N
done	N
getting	N
everything	N

I	N
headed	N
to	N

the	N

There	N
was	N
a	N
line	N

so	N
I	N
got	N
in	N
line	N
to	N
wait	N
my	N
turn	N
.	N
	
Once	N
it	N
was	N

She	N

and	N
made	N

After	N

rung	N
up	N

everything	N
,	N
I	N
paid	N
her	N
and	N
got	N
my	N
things	N
back	N
into	N
my	N
buggy	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
was	N
all	N
done	N
!	N
I	N
headed	N
to	N
the	N
car	N
to	N
put	N
my	N
groceries	N
in	N
the	N
trunk	C
and	N
return	N
the	N
buggy	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
nice	N
and	N
quick	N
grocery	N
trip	N
.	N
	
Today	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
go	N
grocery	N
shopping	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
a	N
list	N
detailing	N
what	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
buy	N
,	N
then	N
decided	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
discount	N
grocery	N
store	N
where	N
I	N
could	N
get	N
everything	N
on	N
my	N
list	N
in	N
one	N
stop	N
.	N
	
I	N
drove	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
,	N
and	N
parked	N
near	N
the	N
front	N
.	N
	
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
basket	N
and	N
went	N
inside	N
.	N
	
The	N
first	N
thing	N
I	N
saw	N
was	N
the	N
muffins	N
that	N
were	N
on	N
my	N
list	N
.	N
	
They	N
were	N
by	N
the	N
front	N
door	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
picked	N
some	N
out	N
and	N
put	N
them	N
in	N
my	N
basket	N
.	N
	
I	N
also	N
needed	N
peanut	N
butter	N
,	N
which	N
was	N
at	N
the	N
back	N
of	N
the	N
store	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
back	N
and	N
chose	N
my	N
favorite	N
peanut	N
butter	N
.	N
	
The	N
last	N
thing	N
I	N
needed	N
was	N
bread	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
down	N
the	N
middle	C
of	N
the	N
store	N
looking	N
down	N
each	N
aisle	N
to	N
see	N
if	N
I	N
saw	N
anything	N
that	N
I	N
forgot	N
to	N
put	N
on	N
my	N
list	N
.	N
	
I	N
did	N
n't	N
see	N
anything	N
I	N
needed	N
,	N
but	N
had	N
to	N
resist	C
the	N
temptation	C
to	N
buy	N
some	N
ice	N
cream	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
got	N
to	N
the	N
front	N
of	N
the	N
store	N
,	N
I	N
picked	N
out	N
a	N
loaf	C
of	N
bread	N
and	N
went	N
to	N
stand	N
in	N
line	N
to	N
check	N
out	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
busy	N
,	N
but	N
a	N
new	N
line	N
was	N
just	N
opening	C
up	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
get	N
near	N
the	N
front	N
of	N
the	N
line	N
.	N
	
The	N
cashier	N
rang	N
me	N
up	N
and	N
I	N
paid	N
with	N
my	N
debit	C
card	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
my	N
groceries	N
in	N
a	N
paper	N
bag	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
left	N
the	N
store	N
and	N
drove	N
home	N
.	N
	
The	N
previous	N
night	N
and	N
this	N
morning	N
before	N
work	N
I	N
noticed	N
I	N
was	N
missing	N
a	N
lot	N
of	N
necessary	N
ingredients	N
for	N
my	N
future	N
meals	N
.	N
	
I	N
planned	N
out	N
a	N
trip	N
to	N
the	N
grocery	N
store	N
immediately	N
after	N
work	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
finished	N
working	N
I	N
drove	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
store	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
very	N
crowded	N
but	N
not	N
too	N
hard	N
to	N
find	N
a	N
parking	N
spot	N
.	N
	
Once	N
inside	N
the	N
store	N
,	N
I	N
grabbed	N
the	N
nearest	N
shopping	N
cart	N
and	N
smiled	N
as	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
grocery	N
workers	N
welcomed	N
me	N
in	N
.	N
	
Once	N
inside	N
and	N
out	N
of	N
everyone	N
's	N
way	N
,	N
I	N
thought	N
about	N
what	N
I	N
needed	N
.	N
	
Since	N
I	N
did	N
n't	N
have	N
a	N
list	N
written	N
down	N
,	N
it	N
took	N
me	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
came	N
up	N
with	N
the	N
list	N
in	N
my	N
head	N
,	N
I	N
started	N
to	N
map	N
out	N
a	N
route	N
in	N
my	N
head	N
that	N
would	N
take	N
the	N
least	N
amount	N
of	N
time	N
for	N
me	N
to	N
follow	N
in	N
the	N
store	N
.	N
	
First	N
,	N
I	N
picked	N
up	N
my	N
deli	N
.	N
	
They	N
offered	N
me	N
some	N
free	N
samples	N
of	N
the	N
meat	N
I	N
asked	N
for	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
picked	N
up	N
my	N
bread	N
which	N
was	N
right	N
nearby	N
.	N
	
At	N
the	N
back	N
wall	N
of	N
the	N
store	N
I	N
found	C
the	N
meat	N
I	N
was	N
going	N
to	N
cook	N
tonight	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
,	N
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
few	N
extra	N
items	N
that	N
I	N
thought	N
might	N
also	N
be	N
nice	N
later	N
this	N
week	N
while	N
heading	C
towards	N
checkout	N
.	N
	
Luckily	N
,	N
there	N
was	N
n't	N
a	N
line	N
and	N
this	N
was	N
done	N
quickly	N
.	N
	
I	N
paid	N
with	N
my	N
debit	C
card	N
and	N
left	N
with	N
all	N
my	N
groceries	N
in	N
a	N
cart	N
,	N
packed	C
them	N
into	N
my	N
car	N
,	N
and	N
headed	N
home	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
corner	N
market	N
with	N
my	N
list	N
of	N
things	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
buy	N
.	N
	
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
shopping	N
cart	N
and	N
wheeled	N
it	N
up	N
and	N
down	N
the	N
aisles	N
.	N
	
I	N
started	N
at	N
aisle	N
one	N
and	N
went	N
through	N
each	N
one	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
that	N
I	N
got	N
everything	N
I	N
needed	N
.	N
	
Fruit	N
and	N
vegetables	N
were	N
placed	N
in	N
flimsy	N
plastic	N
bags	N
that	N
the	N
market	N
provided	N
for	N
me	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
eggs	N
and	N
placed	N
them	N
in	N
the	N
cart	N
's	N
basket	N
so	N
they	N
would	N
n't	N
get	N
broken	N
.	N
	
All	N
other	N
items	N
were	N
tossed	N
in	N
the	N
cart	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
got	N
everything	N
on	N
my	N
list	N
,	N
I	N
rolled	N
the	N
cart	N
to	N
the	N
cashier	N
.	N
	
He	N
scanned	N
all	N
my	N
products	N
and	N
gave	N
me	N
a	N
final	N
,	N
total	N
price	N
.	N
	
A	N
grocery	N
bagger	N
put	N
all	N
of	N
my	N
items	N
in	N
paper	N
bags	N
.	N
	
I	N
paid	N
the	N
cashier	N
in	N
cash	N
and	N
he	N
gave	N
me	N
change	N
.	N
	
I	N
thanked	N
him	N
,	N
I	N
thanked	N
the	N
bagger	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
I	N
left	N
with	N
my	N
groceries	N
.	N
	
Being	N
that	N
we	N
needed	N
food	N
in	N
the	N
house	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
through	N
the	N
cupboards	N
and	N
refrigerator	N
to	N
see	N
what	N
was	N
there	N
and	N
made	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
what	N
we	N
needed	N
.	N
	
We	N
were	N
almost	N
out	N
of	N
food	N
so	N
it	N
was	N
a	N
long	N
list	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
drove	N
to	N
the	N
grocery	N
store	N
.	N
	
First	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
meat	N
isle	N
and	N
picked	N
out	N
some	N
juicy	N
steaks	N
and	N
a	N
chicken	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
went	N
the	N
the	N
vegetable	N
isle	N
and	N
picked	N
out	N
some	N
fresh	N
asparagus	N
,	N
broccoli	N
,	N
and	N
salad	N
fixings	N
.	N
	
Next	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
canned	C
goods	N
and	N
picked	N
out	N
some	N
cans	N
to	N
keep	N
in	N
the	N
house	N
.	N
	
I	N
picked	N
out	N
some	N
chili	N
,	N
soups	N
and	N
stews	N
.	N
	
These	N
are	N
always	N
good	N
to	N
have	N
in	N
the	N
house	N
for	N
a	N
quick	N
meal	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
dairy	C
section	N
and	N
picked	N
out	N
some	N
sour	N
cream	N
and	N
milk	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
pushed	N
the	N
cart	N
to	N
the	N
payment	C
isles	N
and	N
paid	N
for	N
the	N
groceries	N
.	N
	
I	N
love	N
going	N
grocery	N
shopping	N
!	N
I	N
have	N
a	N
very	N
specific	C
way	N
that	N
I	N
approach	N
it	N
and	N
I	N
do	N
the	N
same	N
thing	N
each	N
week	N
.	N
	
On	N
Tuesdays	N
,	N
the	N
grocery	N
ads	N
come	N
out	N
for	N
the	N
week	N
.	N
	
I	N
look	N
through	N
them	N
and	N
make	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
what	N
is	N
on	N
sale	C
.	N
	
I	N
meal	N
plan	N
around	N
those	N
things	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
have	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
what	N
I	N
will	N
be	N
cooking	N
,	N
I	N
write	N
those	N
ingredients	N
down	N
along	N
with	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
other	N
things	N
I	N
want	N
or	N
need	N
.	N
	
I	N
separate	N
them	N
by	N
department	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
dairy	C
items	N
together	N
,	N
then	N
the	N
meat	N
items	N
,	N
followed	N
by	N
the	N
produce	N
,	N
and	N
so	N
on	N
.	N
	
This	N
makes	N
it	N
more	N
efficient	N
when	N
I	N
am	N
pushing	N
a	N
cart	N
through	N
the	N
store	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
'm	N
at	N
the	N
store	N
,	N
I	N
select	N
my	N
items	N
quickly	N
.	N
	
I	N
usually	N
buy	N
the	N
same	N
brands	N
and	N
often	N
the	N
same	N
items	N
each	N
week	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
know	N
where	N
everything	N
is	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
'm	N
ready	N
,	N
I	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
checkout	N
and	N
put	N
it	N
all	N
on	N
the	N
belt	N
so	N
I	N
can	N
pay	N
for	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
love	N
grocery	N
shopping	N
but	N
I	N
hate	N
to	N
put	N
it	N
all	N
away	N
when	N
I	N
get	N
home	N
!	N
My	N
fridge	N
was	N
completely	N
empty	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
knew	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
go	N
get	N
some	N
groceries	N
.	N
	
I	N
drove	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
supermarket	N
and	N
parked	N
my	N
car	N
.	N
	
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
shopping	N
cart	N
from	N
the	N
front	N
of	N
the	N
store	N
and	N
walked	N
through	N
the	N
big	N
sliding	N
doors	N
.	N
	
It	N
's	N
amazing	N
how	N
many	N
kinds	N
of	N
food	N
there	N
are	N
to	N
buy	N
there	N
.	N
	
Luckily	N
,	N
I	N
had	N
made	N
a	N
shopping	N
list	N
before	N
I	N
left	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
knew	N
exactly	N
what	N
I	N
needed	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
through	N
the	N
produce	N
section	N
and	N
picked	N
out	N
some	N
of	N
the	N
best	N
fruits	N
and	N
vegetables	N
.	N
	
I	N
picked	N
up	N
a	N
gallon	N
of	N
milk	N
from	N
the	N
dairy	C
section	N
.	N
	
Up	N
ahead	N
was	N
the	N
bakery	C
and	N
some	N
fresh	N
bread	N
.	N
	
Down	N
the	N
middle	C
I	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
pick	N
up	N
some	N
baking	N
soda	N
,	N
flour	N
,	N
and	N
other	N
baking	N
supplies	N
.	N
	
I	N
needed	N
some	N
cereal	N
for	N
breakfast	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
looked	N
around	N
until	N
I	N
found	C
that	N
aisle	N
.	N
	
My	N
cart	N
was	N
just	N
about	N
full	N
when	N
I	N
had	N
everything	N
I	N
needed	N
.	N
	
I	N
headed	N
for	N
the	N
checkout	N
and	N
put	N
all	N
my	N
groceries	N
on	N
the	N
counter	C
.	N
	
The	N
cashier	N
scanned	N
each	N
thing	N
and	N
added	N
up	N
my	N
total	N
.	N
	
I	N
handed	N
him	N
my	N
money	N
,	N
helped	N
him	N
bag	N
up	N
the	N
groceries	N
,	N
and	N
headed	N
out	N
.	N
	
I	N
loaded	N
up	N
the	N
bags	N
into	N
my	N
car	N
,	N
put	N
the	N
cart	N
back	N
up	N
,	N
and	N
headed	N
home	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
out	N
of	N
food	N
so	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
my	N
local	N
market	N
.	N
	
I	N
parked	N
the	N
car	N
and	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
door	N
.	N
	
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
cart	N
on	N
the	N
way	N
.	N
	
Once	N
inside	N
i	N
vowed	N
to	N
stick	N
to	N
the	N
outside	N
edges	N
of	N
the	N
store	N
,	N
away	N
from	N
processed	N
foods	N
.	N
	
I	N
bought	N
all	N
my	N
produce	N
and	N
some	N
fresh	N
baked	N
bread	N
.	N
	
I	N
also	N
got	N
milk	N
and	N
eggs	N
and	N
cheese	N
.	N
	
I	N
caved	N
and	N
bought	N
some	N
tortilla	N
chips	N
because	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
mean	N
craving	C
for	N
nachos	N
.	N
	
I	N
also	N
checked	N
the	N
frozen	N
aisle	N
for	N
cheese	N
taquitos	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
cheese	N
taquitos	N
once	N
,	N
years	N
ago	N
,	N
but	N
had	N
never	N
seen	N
them	N
again	N
.	N
	
I	N
always	N
check	N
in	N
vain	C
,	N
hoping	N
one	N
day	N
to	N
see	N
them	N
next	N
to	N
the	N
chicken	N
taquitos	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
had	N
all	N
my	N
goods	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
check	N
out	N
line	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
small	N
talk	N
with	N
the	N
cashier	N
after	N
I	N
loaded	N
my	N
items	N
on	N
the	N
the	N
conveyor	N
belt	N
.	N
	
I	N
paid	N
after	N
everything	N
was	N
bagged	N
in	N
my	N
cart	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
left	N
for	N
home	N
.	N
	
Once	N
a	N
week	N
I	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
grocery	N
store	N
to	N
do	N
some	N
food	N
shopping	N
.	N
	
Before	N
I	N
left	N
the	N
house	N
my	N
wife	N
gave	N
me	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
things	N
that	N
we	N
needed	N
.	N
	
I	N
grabbed	N
my	N
shopping	N
cart	N
and	N
the	N
list	N
and	N
started	N
walking	N
to	N
the	N
supermarket	N
that	N
was	N
2	N
blocks	N
away	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
got	N
there	N
I	N
walked	N
up	N

down	N
the	N
aisles	N
looking	N
for	N
the	N

that	N
were	N
on	N
the	N
list	N
.	N
	
As	N
I	N
found	C
each	N
item	N
,	N
I	N
placed	N
them	N
into	N
my	N
shopping	N
cart	N
and	N
crossed	N
them	N
off	N
the	N

When	N
I	N
finally	N
found	C
everything	N
we	N
needed	N
I	N
made	N
my	N
way	N
towards	N
the	N
check	N
out	N
line	N
to	N
pay	N
for	N
the	N
food	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
a	N
cashier	N
that	N
did	N
n't	N
have	N
anyone	N
on	N
her	N
line	N
and	N
I	N
made	N
my	N
way	N
towards	N
her	N

I	N
gave	N
her	N
each	N
item	N
one	N

time	N
and	N
watched	N
her	N
scan	C
and	N
place	N
them	N
into	N
bags	N
for	N
me	N

After	N
she	N
was	N
finished	N
she	N
told	N
me	N
the	N
total	N
amount	N
and	N
I	N
gave	N
her	N
the	N

cover	N
the	N

She	N
gave	N

Yesterday	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
grocery	N
store	N
to	N
buy	N
food	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
my	N
locally-owned	N
supermarket	N
,	N
Bet-R	N
,	N
because	N
I	N
like	N
to	N
support	N
small	N
businesses	N
.	N
	
I	N
go	N
in	N
the	N
early	N
afternoons	N
when	N
I	N
can	N
to	N
avoid	N
the	N
rush	C
of	N
people	N
going	N
after	N
school	N
or	N
work	N
--	N
that	N
way	N
I	N
do	N
n't	N
have	N
to	N
wait	N
in	N
long	N
lines	N
at	N
checkout	N
.	N
	
I	N
brought	N

eggs	N
,	N
milk	N
,	N
bread	N
,	N

and	N
other	N
staples	N

I	N
picked	N
up	N
a	N
handbasket	N
as	N
my	N
list	N
was	N
not	N
large	N
and	N
began	N
to	N
peruse	N
the	N
aisles	N
.	N
	
I	N
picked	N
up	N
everything	N
on	N
my	N
list	N
,	N
except	N
one	N

.	N
	
They	N
were	N
out	N
of	N
my	N
favorite	N
variety	N
of	N
pasta	N
sauce	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
bought	N
a	N
new	N
kind	N
to	N
try	N
instead	N
.	N
	
I	N
did	N
not	N
intend	N
to	N
pick	N
up	N
anything	N
that	N
was	N
not	N
on	N
my	N
list	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
noticed	N
the	N
pints	N
of	N
strawberries	N
were	N
very	N
inexpensive	N
and	N
decided	N
to	N
buy	N
some	N
as	N
well	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
finished	N
in	N
about	N

Then	N
I	N
returned	N
home	N

I	N
was	N

so	N
I	N
needed	N

I	N
made	N

needed	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N

I	N

needed	N
and	N
put	N

When	N

was	N
done	N
getting	N
everything	N
I	N
stood	N

to	N
check	N
out	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
my	N

belt	N
and	N
the	N
cashier	N
rung	N
up	N
my	N

She	N
told	N
me	N
the	N
total	N
cost	N
of	N
all	N
of	N

items	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N

and	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
appropriate	C
money	N
and	N
paid	N
the	N

The	N

drove	N
home	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
running	N
low	N
on	N
food	N

so	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
trip	N
to	N
the	N
grocery	N
store	N
.	N
	
First	N
I	N
wrote	N
down	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
everything	N
I	N
would	N
need	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
hopped	N
in	N
my	N
car	N
and	N
drove	N
over	N
there	N
.	N
	
I	N
parked	N
where	N
I	N
could	N
find	N

space	N
and	N
headed	N
into	N
the	N
store	N
.	N
	
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
shopping	N
cart	N
and	N
went	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
bread	N
section	N
.	N
	
There	N
I	N
picked	N
out	N
a	N
good	N
loaf	C
of	N
bread	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
,	N
I	N
looked	N
at	N
all	N
the	N
fruits	N
and	N
vegetables	N
.	N
	
I	N
picked	N
out	N
a	N
bag	N
of	N
oranges	N
and	N
kept	N
going	N
.	N
	
There	N
were	N
a	N
few	N
more	N
items	N
on	N
the	N
list	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
found	C
each	N
one	N
and	N
put	N
them	N
in	N
my	N
cart	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
finished	N
finding	N
everything	N
on	N
my	N
list	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
check	N
out	N
lines	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
a	N
line	N
with	N
only	N
one	N
person	N
in	N
front	N
of	N
me	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
waited	N
there	N
.	N
	
When	N
it	N
was	N

I	N
put	N

Then	N

She	N
then	N

,	N
and	N
how	N
many	N
packed	C
lunches	N
I	N

I	N
started	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
things	N
to	N
buy	N
after	N
planning	C
my	N
meals	N
.	N
	
The	N

After	N

me	N
which	N
would	N
be	N
filled	N

i	N

Chips	N

the	N
things	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
get	N
.	N
	
I	N
drove	N
to	N
the	N
supermarket	N

decided	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
big	N
shopping	N
cart	N
to	N
put	N
everything	N
in	N

I	N
checked	N

list	N
and	N
then	N
pushed	N
my	N
shopping	N
cart	N
from	N
aisle	N
to	N
aisle	N
.	N
	
I	N
saw	N
that	N
the	N
chips	N
were	N
on	N
sale	C
so	N
I	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
get	N
an	N
extra	N
bag	N
.	N
	
After	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
snacks	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
frozen	N
aisle	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
get	N
the	N
pizza	N
and	N
mozzarella	N
sticks	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
time	N
for	N
checkout	N
so	N
i	N
waited	N
on	N
line	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
my	N
turn	N
.	N
	
The	N
cashier	N
scanned	N
my	N
items	N

I	N
swiped	N
my	N
credit	N
card	N
to	N
pay	N

them	N

She	N
bagged	N
everything	N
up	N
and	N
I	N
was	N
ready	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
my	N
way	N
home	N
.	N
	
Yesterday	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
haircut	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
walked	N
into	N
the	N
salon	C
,	N
a	N
lady	N
named	N
Sara	N
came	N
over	N
and	N
told	N
me	N
to	N
follow	N
her	N
to	N
the	N
shampoo	N
station	N
.	N
	
I	N
sat	N
in	N
a	N
chair	N
and	N
another	N
lady	N
named	N
Marsha	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
put	N
a	N
towel	N
around	N
my	N
head	N
.	N
	
She	N
then	N
took	N
me	N
over	N
to	N
Sara	N
who	N
asked	N
me	N
to	N
sit	N
in	N
her	N
chair	N
and	N
put	N
a	N
cape	N
around	N
my	N
neck	N
.	N
	
Next	N
Sara	N
asked	N
me	N
how	N
short	N
I	N
wanted	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
I	N
told	N
her	N
I	N
still	N
wanted	N
it	N
to	N
be	N
a	N
little	N
past	N
my	N
shoulders	N
,	N
therefore	N
,	N
she	N
should	N
only	N
cut	N
off	N
about	N
1	N
inch	N
.	N
	
She	N
told	N
me	N
that	N
was	N
fine	N
and	N
began	N
cutting	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
It	N
took	N
her	N
about	N
twenty	N
minutes	N
to	N
cut	N
an	N
inch	N
off	N
of	N
all	N
of	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
After	N
she	N
cut	N
it	N
,	N
she	N
took	N
the	N
blow	N
dryer	N
out	N
and	N
dried	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
Then	N
she	N
curled	N
it	N
with	N
a	N
curling	N
iron	N
.	N
	
It	N
looked	N
really	N
great	N
!	N
So	N
I	N
paid	N
her	N
for	N
cutting	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
told	N
her	N
how	N
much	N
I	N
appreciated	N
the	N
great	N
job	N
that	N
she	N
did	N
for	N
me	N
!	N
Yesterday	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
my	N
local	N
barber	N
.	N
	
I	N
told	N
him	N
I	N
wanted	N
the	N
buzz	C
cut	N
and	N
he	N
sat	N
me	N
down	N
in	N
the	N
barber	N
's	N
chair	N
.	N
	
He	N
put	N
a	N
plastic	N
sheet	N
over	N
my	N
front	N
so	N
that	N
I	N
would	N
n't	N
get	N
hair	N
on	N
my	N
clothes	N
.	N
	
He	N
then	N
raised	N
the	N
chair	N
to	N
his	N
preferred	N
height	N
.	N
	
He	N
combed	N
out	N
my	N
hair	N
to	N
get	N
it	N
ready	N
.	N
	
He	N
got	N
his	N
mechanical	C
clippers	N
and	N
buzzed	N
around	N
my	N
head	N
.	N
	
He	N
was	N
careful	N
not	N
to	N
get	N
hair	N
in	N
my	N
eyes	N
.	N
	
I	N
sat	N
calmly	C
as	N
he	N
made	N
his	N
way	N
around	N
my	N
head	N
and	N
tried	N
to	N
move	N
as	N
little	N
as	N
possible	N
so	N
that	N
he	N
would	N
not	N
make	N
any	N
mistakes	N
.	N
	
After	N
every	N
few	N
minutes	N
,	N
he	N
asked	N
what	N
I	N
thought	N
about	N
the	N
progress	N
.	N
	
I	N
gave	N
him	N
some	N
additional	C
input	C
as	N
to	N
the	N
type	N
of	N
style	N
I	N
wanted	N
and	N
he	N
gladly	N
obliged	N
.	N
	
Once	N
my	N
hair	N
was	N
cut	N
,	N
he	N
gave	N
me	N
a	N
mirror	N
to	N
check	N
out	N
the	N
back	N
of	N
my	N
head	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
quite	N
satisfied	N
.	N
	
He	N
brushed	N
away	N
all	N
remaining	C
cut	N
hair	N
,	N
took	N
away	N
the	N
plastic	N
sheet	N
,	N
lowered	N
the	N
chair	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
paid	N
him	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
really	N
long	N
,	N
really	N
straight	N
hair	N
.	N
	
One	N
day	N
a	N
friend	N
of	N
mine	N
mentioned	N
a	N
charity	N
called	N
``	N
``	N
Locks	N

Love	N
``	N
``	N
.	N
	
People	N

off	N
and	N
donate	C
it	N
to	N
make	N
wigs	N
for	N
people	N
with	N
cancer	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
do	N
it	N
!	N
I	N
made	N
an	N
appointment	N
with	N
a	N
hair	N
stylist	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
see	N
him	N
and	N
told	N
him	N
of	N
my	N
plan	N
.	N
	
He	N
started	N
by	N
washing	N
and	N
conditioning	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
I	N
sat	N
in	N
a	N
chair	N
that	N
leaned	N
backwards	N
so	N
my	N
head	N
would	N
go	N
in	N
the	N
sink	N
.	N
	
The	N
water	N
was	N
warm	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
was	N
done	N
,	N
he	N
put	N
a	N
big	N
black	N
cape	N
around	N
my	N
neck	N
and	N
put	N
me	N
in	N
a	N
big	N
chair	N
in	N
front	N
of	N
a	N
mirror	N
.	N
	
He	N
combed	N
my	N
hair	N
straight	N
,	N
put	N
it	N
in	N
a	N
ponytail	N
,	N
then	N
cut	N
off	N
just	N
over	N
1	N
foot	N
of	N
my	N
hair	N
!	N
After	N
he	N
cut	N
it	N
off	N
,	N
he	N
trimmed	N
the	N
rest	N
of	N
my	N
hair	N
,	N
dried	N
it	N
,	N
and	N
styled	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
in	N
the	N
mirror	N
and	N
smiled	N
,	N
knowing	N
I	N
was	N
helping	N
someone	N
else	N
.	N
	
Carla	N
decided	N
to	N
get	N
her	N
hair	N
cut	N
today	N
.	N
	
So	N
,	N
she	N
stopped	N
by	N
a	N
nearby	N
hair	N
salon	C

After	N
saying	C
hello	N
to	N
the	N
hairdresser	N
and	N
waiting	N
for	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
,	N
she	N
sat	N
on	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
chairs	N
that	N
were	N
now	N
free	N
.	N
	
The	N
hairdresser	N
next	N
washed	N
Carla	N
's	N
hair	N
with	N
water	N
and	N
shampoo	N
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
hair	N
was	N
dry	N
,	N
she	N
inspected	N
Carla	N
's	N
face	N
shape	N
and	N
asked	N
what	N
kind	N
of	N
hair	N
style	N
she	N
wanted	N
.	N
	
They	N
discussed	N
this	N
for	N
about	N
a	N
minute	N
before	N
a	N
decision	N
was	N
made	N
.	N
	
The	N
hairdresser	N
then	N
prepared	N
the	N
hair	N
,	N
separating	N
it	N
into	N
different	N
sections	N
before	N
she	N
began	N
cutting	N
it	N
.	N
	
She	N
worked	N
calmly	C
and	N
carefully	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
that	N
she	N
would	N
successfully	C
achieve	N
the	N
style	N
Carla	N
wanted	N

After	N
about	N
30	N
minutes	N
,	N
the	N
hairdresser	N
had	N
almost	N
finished	N
.	N
	
So	N
,	N
she	N
made	N
last-minute	C
touches	N
by	N
drying	N
the	N
hair	N
using	N
a	N
blow	N
dryer	N
,	N
and	N

Once	N

the	N
cut	N
and	N
gave	N
the	N
hairdresser	N
a	N
generous	N
tip	N
.	N
	
It	N
had	N
been	N
a	N
while	N
since	N
I	N
had	N
gotten	N
a	N
hair	N
cut	N
and	N
decided	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
the	N
number	N
of	N
the	N
salon	C
in	N
the	N
phone	N
book	N
and	N
called	N
to	N
make	N
an	N
appointment	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
drove	N
to	N
the	N
salon	C
.	N
	
My	N
favorite	N
stylist	N
was	N
there	N
and	N
she	N
greeted	N
me	N
and	N
had	N
me	N
sit	N
down	N
in	N
a	N
chair	N
that	N
was	N
in	N
her	N
booth	N
.	N
	
She	N
wrapped	N
a	N
plastic	N
protector	N
over	N
me	N
and	N
bent	N
the	N
chair	N
back	N
.	N
	
Then	N
she	N
shampooed	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
Then	N
she	N
combed	N
my	N
hair	N
to	N
get	N
it	N
ready	N
to	N
be	N
cut	N
.	N
	
Then	N
she	N
started	N
cutting	N
my	N
hair	N
with	N
a	N
special	N
pair	N
of	N
scissors	N
.	N
	
She	N
took	N
her	N
time	N
about	N
cutting	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
When	N
she	N
was	N
all	N
done	N
she	N
grabbed	N
a	N
hair	N
dryer	N
and	N
dried	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
thanked	N
her	N
and	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
counter	C
to	N
pay	N
.	N
	
I	N
paid	N
,	N
left	N
the	N
shop	N
and	N
drove	N
home	N
.	N
	
My	N
hair	N
had	N
become	N
very	N
long	N
and	N
shaggy	N
looking	N
so	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
go	N
out	N
and	N
get	N
a	N
haircut	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
Hair	N
Cuttery	N
because	N
it	N
is	N
near	N
my	N
home	N
and	N
they	N
always	N
do	N
a	N
nice	N
job	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
in	N
and	N
told	N
the	N
front	N
desk	N
receptionist	N
that	N
I	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
shampoo	N
,	N
cut	N
and	N
blowdry	N
.	N
	
They	N
took	N
me	N
right	N
away	N
.	N
	
First	N
the	N
attendant	N
shampooed	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
escorted	N
me	N
to	N
the	N
stylist	N
's	N
chair	N
.	N
	
The	N
stylist	N
asked	N
me	N
how	N
I	N
would	N
like	N
my	N
hair	N
cut	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
told	N
her	N
just	N
to	N
trim	N
the	N
ends	N
and	N
shape	N
the	N
bangs	N
and	N
sides	N
a	N
little	N
bit	N
.	N
	
She	N
combed	N
through	N
my	N
hair	N
,	N
clipping	N
up	N
sections	N
at	N
a	N
time	N
to	N
keep	N
them	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
way	N
while	N
she	N
cut	N
the	N
rest	N
of	N
my	N
hair	N
,	N
and	N
went	N
to	N
work	N
.	N
	
After	N
she	N
finished	N
she	N
blow	N
dried	N
my	N
hair	N
in	N
a	N
nice	N
style	N
.	N
	
I	N
thanked	N
her	N
and	N
after	N
I	N
paid	N
I	N
left	N
her	N
a	N
good	N
tip	N
.	N
	
My	N
hair	N
had	N
gotten	N
really	N
long	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
haircut	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
downtown	N
to	N
the	N
barber	N
shop	N
and	N
checked	N
in	N
.	N
	
There	N
a	N
few	N
people	N
ahead	N
of	N
me	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
wait	N
a	N
little	N
while	N
.	N
	
But	N
that	N
gave	N
me	N
some	N
time	N
to	N
look	N
in	N
the	N
books	N
to	N
pick	N
out	N
a	N
good	N
style	N
for	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
When	N
it	N
was	N
my	N
turn	N
,	N
I	N
showed	N
the	N
barber	N
how	N
I	N
wanted	N
my	N
hair	N
cut	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
up	N
in	N
the	N
barber	N
chair	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
barber	N
put	N
a	N
paper	N
towel	N
around	N
my	N
neck	N
so	N
the	N
hair	N
would	N
n't	N
get	N
down	N
on	N
my	N
shirt	N
.	N
	
He	N
put	N
an	N
apron	N
on	N
over	N
me	N
,	N
and	N
started	N
cutting	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
I	N
watched	N
in	N
the	N
mirror	N
as	N
bits	N
of	N
hair	N
would	N
fall	N
down	N
as	N
he	N
cut	N
.	N
	
I	N
started	N
to	N
see	N
the	N
design	N
I	N
had	N
chosen	N
take	N
shape	N
.	N
	
Before	N
I	N
knew	N
it	N
,	N
he	N
was	N
brushing	N
some	N
loose	N
hair	N
off	N
with	N
his	N
brush	N
and	N
I	N
was	N
all	N
done	N
.	N
	
He	N
did	N
a	N
great	N
job	N
,	N
and	N
my	N
hair	N
is	N
just	N
how	N
I	N
want	N
it	N
.	N
	
Today	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
go	N
get	N
a	N
haircut	N
.	N
	
I	N
've	N
been	N
waiting	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
haircut	N
for	N
a	N
while	N
but	N
finally	N
I	N
decided	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
to	N
get	N
it	N
.	N
	
So	N
I	N
went	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
barbershop	N
near	N
my	N
house	N
.	N
	
Once	N
inside	N
the	N
barbershop	N
I	N
told	N
the	N
barber	N
that	N
I	N
needed	N
a	N
haircut	N
and	N
took	N
my	N
seat	N
util	N
they	N
called	N
my	N
name	N
.	N
	
Once	N
they	N
called	N
my	N
name	N
I	N
went	N
and	N
sat	N
at	N
the	N
chair	N
and	N
the	N
barber	N
put	N
a	N
towel	N
over	N
me	N
so	N
that	N
the	N
hair	N
that	N
he	N
cuts	N
does	N
n't	N
get	N
over	N
my	N
clothes	N
.	N
	
I	N
tell	N
him	N
what	N
kind	N
of	N
haircut	N
I	N
want	N
and	N
then	N
he	N
begins	N
to	N
cut	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
He	N
periodically	N
asks	N
me	N
if	N
he	N
is	N
doing	N
a	N
good	N
job	N
throughout	C
the	N
haircut	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
that	N
I	N
am	N
happy	N
with	N
the	N
hair	N
that	N
he	N
is	N
cutting	N
.	N
	
I	N
reassure	C
him	N
that	N
he	N
is	N
doing	N
a	N
good	N
job	N
and	N
after	N
he	N
is	N
done	N
he	N
takes	N
off	N
the	N
towel	N
and	N
I	N
get	N
a	N
final	N
look	N
at	N
my	N
haircut	N
.	N
	
I	N
nod	C
my	N
head	N
,	N
pay	N
him	N
for	N
the	N
haircut	N
and	N
also	N
a	N
tip	N
and	N
leave	N
the	N
barbershop	N
after	N
that	N
.	N
	
I	N
have	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
shower	N
afterwards	N
for	N
some	N
hair	N
that	N
happened	N
to	N
get	N
down	N
the	N
back	N
of	N
my	N
shirt	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
a	N
job	N
interview	N
coming	N
up	N
in	N
a	N
couple	N
days	C
.	N
	
After	N
filling	N
out	N
so	N
many	N
applications	N
I	N
noticed	N
that	N
my	N
hair	N
was	N
getting	N
very	N
long	N
.	N
	
So	N
I	N
ended	N
up	N
deciding	N
to	N
get	N
my	N
hair	N
cut	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
look	N
good	N
for	N
the	N
upcoming	C
interview	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
in	N
the	N
care	N
in	N
the	N
early	N
afternoon	N
and	N
drove	N
off	N
to	N
my	N
usual	N
barber	N
.	N
	
I	N
have	N
been	N
going	N
to	N
this	N
barber	N
for	N
the	N
last	N
5	N
years	N
,	N
and	N
never	N
had	N
a	N
problem	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
arrived	N
for	N
the	N
appointment	N
,	N
I	N
sat	N
down	N
on	N
the	N
chair	N
and	N
told	N
her	N
I	N
wanted	N
the	N
usual	N
.	N
	
She	N
asked	N
what	N
the	N
occasion	N
was	N
and	N
I	N
told	N
her	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
job	N
interview	N
in	N
a	N
couple	N
days	C
.	N
	
She	N
wished	N
me	N
the	N
best	N
of	N
luck	N
while	N
she	N
continued	N
cutting	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
After	N
some	N
conversation	N
,	N
she	N
was	N
done	N
.	N
	
I	N
ended	N
up	N
paying	N
her	N
a	N
good	N
tip	N
considering	C
I	N
felt	N
bad	N
that	N
I	N
did	N
n't	N
get	N
a	N
good	N
hair	N
cut	N
in	N
a	N
long	N
time	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
into	N
the	N
barber	N
shop	N
.	N
	
There	N
were	N
three	N
barber	N
's	N
chair	N
lined	N
up	N
along	N
the	N
wall	N
.	N
	
Each	N
one	N
had	N
a	N
customer	N
in	N
it	N
who	N
was	N
already	N
getting	N
a	N
haircut	N
so	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
wait	N
.	N
	
I	N
read	N
a	N
magazine	N
for	N
about	N
five	N
minutes	N
until	N
a	N
customer	N
paid	N
and	N
left	N
.	N
	
The	N
barber	N
called	N
me	N
over	N
,	N
put	N
a	N
smock	N
on	N
me	N
,	N
and	N
asked	N
me	N
how	N
I	N
liked	N
my	N
hair	N
cut	N
.	N
	
I	N
told	N
him	N
I	N
liked	N
it	N
short	N
all	N
over	N
.	N
	
He	N
wet	N
my	N
hair	N
down	N
with	N
a	N
spray	C
bottle	N
of	N
water	N
and	N
then	N
started	N
cutting	N
my	N
hair	N
on	N
the	N
top	N
and	N
sides	N
with	N
scissors	N
.	N
	
After	N
he	N
had	N
thinned	N
it	N
out	N
a	N
bit	N
,	N
he	N
shaved	N
the	N
sides	N
and	N
back	N
with	N
electric	N
clippers	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
,	N
he	N
put	N
hot	N
foam	N
on	N
my	N
neck	N
and	N
used	N
a	N
straight	N
razor	C
to	N
shave	N
my	N
neck	N
and	N
leave	N
a	N
clean	N
neat	N
hairline	N
.	N
	
He	N
showed	N
me	N
how	N
it	N
looked	N
in	N
the	N
mirror	N
and	N
I	N
approved	N
.	N
	
The	N
barber	N
whipped	N
off	N
the	N
smock	N
and	N
I	N
paid	N
him	N
,	N
giving	N
him	N
a	N
tip	N
as	N
well	N
.	N
	
Now	N
I	N
was	N
ready	N
for	N
my	N
big	N
date	N
!	N
I	N
was	N
looking	N
in	N
the	N
mirror	N
this	N
morning	N
and	N
noticed	N
my	N
hair	N
had	N
gotten	N
out	N
of	N
control	N
.	N
	
So	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
hair	N
cut	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
new	N
to	N
the	N
area	N
,	N
so	N
first	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
research	N
all	N
the	N
available	N
barber	N
shops	N
nearby	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
three	N
different	N
places	N
,	N
and	N
all	N
with	N
great	N
reviews	N
.	N
	
So	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
go	N
the	N
closest	N
one	N
to	N
my	N
house	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
got	N
there	N
,	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
wait	N
for	N
the	N
4	N
people	N
currently	C
waiting	N
before	N
I	N
arrived	N
.	N
	
I	N
started	N
looking	N
at	N
the	N
posters	N
on	N
the	N
wall	N
and	N
came	N
up	N
with	N
some	N
new	N
ideas	N
on	N
what	N
hair	N
cut	N
style	N
I	N
think	N
would	N
look	N
best	N
on	N
me	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
on	N
a	N
buzz	C
cut	N
.	N
	
When	N
it	N
was	N
my	N
turn	N
I	N
told	N
the	N
barber	N
I	N
wanted	N
a	N
buzz	C
cut	N
.	N
	
He	N
trimmed	N
my	N
hair	N
low	N
,	N
then	N
got	N
a	N
fine-edge	N
razor	C
to	N
get	N
my	N
hairline	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
out	N
the	N
barber	N
shop	N
feeling	N
like	N
a	N
new	N
man	N
.	N
	
Last	N
week	N
I	N
decided	N
that	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
haircut	N
.	N
	
I	N
called	N
my	N
hairstylist	N
and	N
made	N
an	N
appointment	N
to	N
come	N
in	N
.	N
	
On	N
the	N
day	N
of	N
my	N
appointment	N
I	N
drove	N
to	N
the	N
salon	C
,	N
checked	N
in	N
with	N
the	N
receptionist	N
and	N
sat	N
down	N
and	N
looked	N
through	N
a	N
magazine	N
for	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
until	N
the	N
stylist	N
came	N
out	N
and	N
called	N
my	N
name	N
.	N
	
I	N
followed	N
her	N
back	N
to	N
her	N
booth	N
where	N
she	N
sat	N
me	N
in	N
a	N

She	N
asked	N
me	N
questions	N

and	N
I	N

Then	N
she	N

in	N
front	N
of	N
a	N
small	N
sink	N
where	N

When	N
she	N

and	N

She	N

Once	N

then	N

After	N

of	N
my	N
favorite	N

He	N

asks	N
me	N
what	N
kind	N
of	N
haircut	N
would	N
I	N
like	N
this	N
time	N
and	N
I	N
had	N
said	N

He	N
blows	N
my	N
hair	N
dry	N
first	N
and	N
cuts	N
my	N
hair	N
nicely	C
as	N
always	N
and	N
then	N
ends	N
it	N
by	N
styling	N
it	N
with	N
some	N

I	N

Every	N

starts	N
to	N
feel	N
shaggy	N
,	N
I	N
know	N

is	N
time	N
for	N
a	N

Mom	N
calls	N
to	N
make	N
an	N
appointment	N
with	N
the	N
stylist	N

When	N
we	N
arrive	N
to	N
the	N
salon	C
,	N
the	N
hair	N
dresser	N
greets	N
me	N
.	N
	
She	N
drapes	N
a	N
cape	N
around	N
me	N
to	N
keep	N
hair	N
from	N
sticking	N
to	N
my	N
clothes	N
,	N
and	N
invites	N
me	N
to	N
sit	N
in	N
a	N
special	N
chair	N

First	N
,	N
she	N
leans	N
me	N
back	N
to	N
shampoo	N
and	N
rinse	N
my	N
hair	N

Once	N
my	N

clean	N
,	N
the	N
hair	N
dresser	N
combs	N
it	N
out	N

gently	C
removing	N
any	N
tangles	N

Then	N
she	N
grabs	N
a	N
pair	N
of	N
professional	N
scissors	N
to	N
cut	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
She	N
trims	N
the	N
ends	N
,	N
which	N
are	N
often	N
damaged	N

Sometimes	N
she	N
will	N
add	N
layers	N
into	N
my	N
hair	N
as	N
well	N

After	N
trimming	N
my	N
hair	N

she	N
uses	N
a	N

to	N
dry	N
it	N

Finally	N
,	N
she	N
brushes	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
When	N
she	N
is	N
finished	N
,	N
I	N
look	N
in	N
the	N
mirror	N
,	N
pleased	N
with	N
my	N
freshly	N
cut	N
hair	N
.	N
	
I	N
hop	C
off	N
the	N
chair	N
and	N
remove	N
the	N
cape	N
.	N
	
After	N
mom	N
pays	N
the	N
stylist	N
,	N
I	N
thank	N
her	N
and	N
say	N
``	N

``	N
Today	N
I	N

Last	N
time	N
I	N
was	N
at	N
the	N
stylist	N
,	N
I	N
made	N
an	N
appointment	N
for	N
today	N
.	N
	
I	N
arrived	N
about	N
10	N
minutes	N
before	N
my	N
appointment	N
,	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
that	N
I	N
would	N
n't	N
be	N
late	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
walked	N
in	N
,	N
the	N
lady	N
behind	N
the	N
counter	C
greeted	N
me	N
,	N
and	N
asked	N
if	N
I	N
would	N
like	N
something	N
to	N
drink	N
.	N
	
I	N
said	N
no	N
,	N
that	N
I	N
would	N
not	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
had	N
a	N
seat	N
and	N
waited	N
for	N
my	N
stylist	N
to	N
come	N
and	N
collect	N
me	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
the	N
stylist	N
came	N
out	N
and	N
led	N
me	N
back	N
to	N
the	N
area	N
where	N
I	N
would	N
be	N
getting	N
my	N
hair	N
cut	N
.	N
	
First	N
we	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
,	N
then	N
she	N
seated	N
me	N
in	N
a	N
chair	N
that	N
is	N
designed	N
for	N
hair	N
cutting	N
.	N
	
The	N
stylist	N
asked	N
me	N
what	N
type	N
of	N
haircut	N
I	N
wanted	N
,	N
I	N
told	N
her	N
,	N
and	N
she	N
began	N
to	N
cut	N
.	N
	
First	N
she	N
clipped	N
the	N
sides	N
and	N
back	N
,	N
then	N
she	N
used	N
scissors	N
to	N
trim	N
the	N
top	N
and	N
front	N
.	N
	
After	N
she	N
was	N
done	N
she	N
used	N
a	N
blow	N
dryer	N
to	N
blow	N
off	N
all	N
the	N
hair	N
she	N
had	N
cut	N
.	N
	
She	N
then	N
brushed	N
my	N
shoulders	N
with	N
a	N
special	N
hair	N
brush	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
was	N
done	N
.	N
	
My	N
hair	N
was	N
really	N
long	N
and	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
get	N
it	N
cut	N
.	N
	
My	N
mom	N
called	N
the	N
hair	N
salon	C
and	N
made	N
an	N
appointment	N
for	N
me	N
.	N
	
We	N
went	N
into	N
the	N
salon	C
and	N
the	N
receptionist	N
asked	N
us	N
for	N
our	N
name	N
.	N
	
We	N
told	N
her	N
what	N
it	N
was	N
and	N
she	N
marked	N
our	N
names	N
off	N
in	N
her	N
book	N
.	N
	
A	N
lady	N
came	N
and	N
took	N
me	N
to	N
an	N
area	N
where	N
there	N
were	N
some	N
really	N
deep	N
sinks	N
.	N
	
She	N
told	N
me	N
to	N
lie	N
back	N
with	N
my	N
neck	N
on	N
the	N
edge	N
of	N
the	N
sink	N
and	N
my	N
hair	N
falling	N
into	N
the	N
sink	N
.	N
	
She	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
with	N
warm	N
water	N
and	N
some	N
nice	N
smelling	N
shampoo	N
.	N
	
She	N
put	N
a	N
towel	N
on	N
my	N
hair	N
to	N
dry	N
it	N
and	N
took	N
me	N
to	N
a	N
special	N
chair	N
.	N
	
The	N
chair	N
had	N
a	N
foot	N
pump	N
that	N
the	N
lady	N
used	N
to	N
raise	N
the	N
chair	N
way	N
up	N
in	N
the	N
air	N
.	N
	
When	N
it	N
was	N
up	N
high	N
enough	N
for	N
me	N
to	N
look	N
into	N
the	N
mirror	N
,	N
she	N
put	N
a	N
cape	N
around	N
my	N
shoulders	N
and	N
began	N
combing	N
out	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N
	
She	N
took	N
out	N
some	N
scissors	N
and	N
used	N
them	N
to	N
cut	N
my	N
hair	N
into	N
a	N
nice	N
style	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
very	N
surprised	N
to	N
find	N
that	N
it	N
did	N
not	N
hurt	N
one	N
bit	N
!	N
She	N
dried	N
my	N
hair	N
with	N
the	N
blow	N
dryer	N
and	N
then	N
it	N
was	N
finished	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
very	N
happy	N
with	N
my	N
new	N
look	N
.	N
	
Although	N
I	N
keep	N
my	N
head	N
mostly	N
shaved	N
very	N
,	N
very	N
short	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
haircut	N
.	N
	
Summer	N
is	N
fast	N
approaching	N
and	N
the	N
shorter	N
the	N
better	N
to	N
keep	N
my	N
old	N
head	N
nice	N
and	N
cool	N
.	N
	
I	N
gathered	N
the	N
clippers	N
,	N
towel	N
,	N
a	N
razor	C
for	N
the	N
neck	N
shave	N
and	N
awaited	N
my	N
wife	N
to	N
get	N
home	N
from	N
her	N
job	N
.	N
	
I	N
always	N
get	N
her	N
to	N
cut	N
my	N
hair	N
as	N
she	N
is	N
really	N
good	N
at	N
it	N
albeit	C
a	N
tad	N
slow	N
getting	N
it	N
done	N
.	N
	
When	N
she	N
arrived	N
she	N
smiled	N
when	N
she	N
saw	N
the	N
tools	N
for	N
a	N
haircut	N
gathered	N
and	N
got	N
right	N
to	N
work	N
.	N
	
She	N
placed	N
the	N
towel	N
over	N
my	N
shoulders	N
and	N
proceeded	N
to	N
get	N
to	N
work	N
with	N
the	N
clippers	N
.	N
	
Fine	N
pieces	N
of	N
hair	N
fell	N
in	N
the	N
floor	N
as	N
she	N
ran	N
the	N
clippers	N
over	N
my	N
head	N
.	N
	
Then	N
my	N
neck	N
was	N
lathered	N
up	N
and	N
the	N
razor	C
used	N
to	N
shave	N
that	N
area	N
.	N
	
A	N
quick	N
shower	N
later	N
and	N
I	N
felt	N
like	N
a	N
new	N
man	N
.	N
	
Friday	N
was	N
Madison	N
's	N
birthday	N
party	N
and	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
that	N
I	N
looked	N
my	N
best	N
.	N
	
I	N
asked	N
my	N
dad	N
to	N
take	N
me	N
to	N
the	N
local	N
barber	N
shop	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
got	N
there	N
,	N
I	N
sat	N
down	N
and	N
saw	N
that	N
there	N
were	N
two	N
other	N
people	N
waiting	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
go	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
magazine	N
rack	N
and	N
I	N
found	C
a	N
magazine	N
about	N
baseball	N
.	N
	
I	N
really	N
enjoyed	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
stories	N
that	N
were	N
in	N
the	N
magazine	N
.	N
	
Before	N
I	N
knew	N
it	N
,	N
the	N
barber	N
called	N
me	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
chair	N
.	N
	
I	N
sat	N
down	N
and	N
then	N
he	N
asked	N
me	N
what	N
kind	N
of	N
haircut	N
I	N
wanted	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
summer	N
so	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
crew	N
cut	N
.	N
	
He	N
started	N
off	N
by	N
using	N
the	N
electric	N
razor	C
on	N
my	N
head	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
,	N
he	N
got	N
out	N
the	N
scissors	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
cut	N
some	N
of	N
the	N
remaining	C
hair	N
.	N
	
After	N
he	N
finished	N
,	N
he	N
put	N
some	N
powder	N
on	N
my	N
face	N
and	N
brushed	N
off	N
any	N
hair	N
that	N
had	N
fallen	N
.	N
	
He	N
showed	N
me	N
the	N
haircut	N
in	N
a	N
mirror	N
and	N
I	N
was	N
pleased	N
.	N
	
''	N
I	N
love	N
everything	N
about	N
libraries	N
;	N
their	N
quiet	N
atmosphere	N
,	N
comfortable	N
chairs	N
,	N
and	N
rows	N
and	N
rows	N
of	N
books	N
on	N
every	N
topic	N
.	N
	
I	N
do	N
n't	N
have	N
enough	N
money	N
to	N
go	N
out	N
and	N
buy	N
books	N
whenever	N
I	N
want	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
often	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
to	N
borrow	N
books	N
for	N
free	N
.	N
	
Recently	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
and	N
just	N
browse	C
until	N
I	N
found	C
something	N
interesting	N
.	N
	
I	N
drove	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
and	N
parked	N
close	N
to	N
the	N
door	N
,	N
since	N
I	N
expected	C
to	N
leave	N
with	N
an	N
armful	N
of	N
heavy	N
books	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
inside	N
and	N
headed	N
for	N
the	N
Fiction	N
section	N
.	N
	
I	N
ended	N
up	N
in	N
the	N
row	N
for	N
authors	N
with	N
last	N
names	N
starting	N
with	N
K	N
,	N
because	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
find	N
Stephen	N
King	N
books	N
.	N
	
They	N
ended	N
up	N
having	N
a	N
dozen	N
books	N
by	N
Stephen	N
King	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
selected	N
three	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
never	N
read	N
before	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
went	N
over	N
to	N
Nonfiction	N
to	N
find	N
a	N
book	N
on	N
gardening	C
,	N
since	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
learn	N
how	N
to	N
grow	N
tomato	N
plants	N
.	N
	
I	N
picked	N
up	N
a	N
gigantic	N
,	N
fantastically	C
long	N
book	N
on	N
how	N
to	N
grow	N
common	N
vegetables	N
and	N
walked	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
reception	N
desk	N
.	N
	
I	N
handed	N
the	N
librarian	N
my	N
card	N
and	N
she	N
checked	N
out	N
my	N
books	N
.	N
	
I	N
gathered	N
them	N
up	N
in	N
my	N
arms	N
and	N
walked	N
back	N
to	N
my	N
car	N
,	N
excited	N
to	N
be	N
able	C
to	N
read	N
them	N
all	N
once	N
I	N
got	N
home	N
.	N
	
Borrowing	N
a	N
book	N
from	N
the	N
library	N
is	N
a	N
big	N
responsibility	C
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
my	N
first	N
library	N
card	N
when	N
I	N
was	N
in	N
middle	C
school	N
.	N
	
I	N
could	N
go	N
right	N
down	N
the	N
street	N
from	N
my	N
house	N
and	N
explore	N
everything	N
the	N
library	N
had	N
to	N
offer	N
.	N
	
My	N
library	N
has	N
books	N
,	N
magazines	N
,	N
computers	N
,	N
movies	N
,	N
anything	N
I	N
need	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
searching	N
for	N
a	N
book	N
around	N
Halloween	N
that	N
had	N
some	N
fun	N
ghost	N
stories	N
.	N
	
My	N
library	N
had	N
the	N
exact	N
book	N
I	N
wanted	N
!	N
The	N
library	N
also	N
had	N
some	N
others	N
.	N
	
I	N
sat	N
around	N
a	N
table	N
with	N
my	N
pile	N
of	N
books	N
and	N
looked	N
through	N
them	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
,	N
I	N
could	N
n't	N
resist	C
and	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
counter	C
with	N
the	N
book	N
I	N
had	N
come	N
there	N
for	N
.	N
	
The	N
librarian	N
was	N
really	N
nice	N
as	N
she	N
took	N
my	N
card	N
and	N
typed	N
into	N
her	N
computer	N
.	N
	
I	N
checked	N
the	N
book	N
out	N
for	N
two	N
weeks	N
.	N
	
This	N
would	N
give	N
me	N
plenty	N
of	N
time	N
to	N
enjoy	N
it	N
and	N
best	N
of	N
all	N
,	N
the	N
librarian	N
let	N
me	N
know	N
I	N
could	N
check	N
it	N
out	N
for	N
even	N
longer	N
if	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
.	N
	
I	N
would	N
just	N
have	N
to	N
bring	N
the	N
book	N
back	N
on	N
the	N
due	N
date	N
and	N
have	N
it	N
scanned	N
out	N
again	N

I	N
took	N
great	N
care	N
of	N
my	N
book	N

returned	N
it	N
on	N
time	N

so	N
many	N
different	N
books	N
to	N
see	N
there	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
got	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
I	N
walked	N
up	N
and	N
down	N
the	N
aisles	N
looking	N
for	N
the	N
perfect	N
book	N
for	N
me	N
.	N
	
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
read	N
a	N
book	N
about	N
horses	N
or	N
basketball	N
.	N
	
I	N
asked	N
the	N
librarian	N
to	N
help	N
me	N
find	N
one	N
.	N
	
She	N
looked	N
on	N
her	N
computer	N
and	N
found	C
a	N
great	N
book	N
about	N
horses	N
but	N
it	N
had	N
already	N
been	N
taken	N
home	N
by	N
someone	N
else	N
.	N
	
So	N
she	N
looked	N
again	N
and	N
found	C
a	N
cool	N
book	N
about	N
basketball	N
.	N
	
She	N
went	N
with	N
me	N
to	N
the	N
shelf	N
and	N
helped	N
me	N
find	N
the	N
book	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
got	N
the	N
book	N
off	N
of	N
the	N
shelf	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
it	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
counter	C
and	N
gave	N
it	N
to	N
a	N
lady	N
behind	N
the	N
desk	N
.	N
	
She	N
asked	N
for	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
.	N
	
I	N
gave	N
her	N
the	N
card	N
and	N
she	N
scanned	N
it	N
and	N
my	N
book	N
.	N
	
Then	N
she	N
gave	N
me	N
a	N
slip	N
of	N
paper	N
that	N
said	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
bring	N
the	N
book	N
back	N
in	N
two	N
weeks	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
very	N
excited	N
to	N
leave	N
the	N
library	N
with	N
a	N
book	N
to	N
read	N
about	N
basketball	N
!	N
I	N
paid	N
a	N
visit	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
a	N
couple	N
of	N
days	C
ago	N
.	N
	
After	N
getting	N
off	N
work	N
at	N
5pm	N
,	N
I	N
walked	N
over	N
to	N
a	N
library	N
branch	N
a	N
couple	N
of	N
blocks	N
from	N
my	N
home	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
looking	N
to	N
borrow	N
a	N
novel	N
that	N
I	N
'd	N
been	N
meaning	N
to	N
read	N
for	N
some	N
time	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
there	N
at	N
around	N
6pm	N
.	N
	
I	N
first	N
logged	N
onto	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
library	N
computers	N
to	N
confirm	N
that	N
the	N
book	N
was	N
still	N
there	N
.	N
	
After	N
confirming	N
this	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
upstairs	N
to	N
the	N
fiction	N
section	N
,	N
located	N
on	N
the	N
second	N
floor	N
of	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
was	N
in	N
the	N
fiction	N
section	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
bookshelves	N
and	N
searched	N
for	N
the	N
novel	N
,	N
successfully	C
finding	N
it	N
fairly	N
quickly	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
walk	N
downstairs	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
's	N
checkout	N
desk	N
.	N
	
I	N
placed	N
the	N
book	N
onto	N
the	N
counter	C
and	N
also	N
took	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
from	N
my	N
wallet	N
.	N
	
I	N
showed	N
the	N
librarian	N
the	N
card	N
,	N
where	N
she	N
then	N
checked	N
out	N
the	N
book	N
after	N
scanning	N
my	N
card	N
.	N
	
Next	N
,	N
once	N
it	N
came	N
out	N
,	N
she	N
handed	N
me	N
a	N
receipt	N
where	N
the	N
return	N
date	N
was	N
printed	N
on	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
received	N
this	N
,	N
I	N
walked	N
to	N
my	N
apartment	N
with	N
the	N
novel	N
in	N
my	N
hand	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
really	N
looking	N
forward	N
to	N
reading	N
the	N
novel	N
.	N
	
A	N
friend	N
of	N
mine	N
told	N
me	N
about	N
a	N
book	N
she	N
liked	N
and	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
read	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
did	N
n't	N
want	N
to	N
buy	N
the	N
book	N
,	N
though	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
first	N
got	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
,	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
register	N
for	N
a	N
library	N
card	N
because	N
you	N
ca	N
n't	N
check	N
out	N
books	N
without	N
it	N
.	N
	
So	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
front	N
desk	N
,	N
filled	N
out	N
a	N
form	N
and	N
then	N
waited	N
.	N
	
The	N
lady	N
at	N
the	N
desk	N
made	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
right	N
then	N
and	N
handed	N
it	N
to	N
me	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
asked	N
her	N
where	N
I	N
would	N
find	N
the	N
book	N
I	N
was	N
looking	N
for	N
and	N
she	N
showed	N
me	N
the	N
right	N
bookshelves	N
.	N
	
I	N
located	N
the	N
book	N
right	N
away	N
and	N
took	N
it	N
from	N
the	N
shelf	N
,	N
but	N
then	N
I	N
stayed	N
to	N
look	N
around	N
for	N
more	N
books	N
.	N
	
The	N
library	N
has	N
a	N
card	N
catalog	N
where	N
you	N
can	N
look	N
up	N
any	N
book	N
you	N
want	N
and	N
the	N
catalog	N
will	N
tell	N
you	N
which	N
shelf	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
for	N
the	N
book	N
.	N
	
So	N
,	N
I	N
used	N
the	N
card	N
catalog	N
to	N
find	N
two	N
more	N
books	N
and	N
then	N
took	N
all	N
my	N
books	N
back	N
to	N
the	N
front	N
desk	N
to	N
check	N
them	N
out	N
.	N
	
The	N
lady	N
at	N
the	N
front	N
desk	N
scanned	N
a	N
bar	N
code	C
in	N
the	N
back	N
of	N
the	N
book	N
and	N
that	N
registered	N
them	N
as	N
checked	N
out	N
to	N
me	N
.	N
	
She	N
told	N
me	N
I	N
would	N
have	N
four	N
weeks	N
to	N
read	N
them	N
.	N
	
After	N
she	N
was	N
finished	N
,	N
I	N
picked	N
up	N
the	N
books	N
and	N
left	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
I	N
needed	N
to	N
learn	N
about	N
gardening	C
and	N
was	N
n't	N
sure	N
where	N
to	N
start	N
.	N
	
A	N
friend	N
of	N
mine	N
recommended	N
a	N
book	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
check	N
it	N
out	N
from	N
the	N
local	N
library	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
Inside	N
there	N
was	N
a	N
computer	N
to	N
look	N
up	N
where	N
books	N
are	N
located	N
.	N
	
I	N
typed	N
in	N
the	N
name	N
of	N
the	N
book	N
I	N
was	N
looking	N
for	N
and	N
it	N
showed	N
me	N
the	N
call	N
number	N
,	N
a	N
unique	C
number	N
used	N
to	N
tell	N
where	N
the	N
book	N
is	N
located	N
in	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
I	N
wrote	N
the	N
call	N
number	N
down	N
and	N
looked	N
at	N
the	N
stacks	N
of	N
books	N
.	N
	
Each	N
stack	N
had	N
a	N
range	N
of	N
numbers	N
printed	N
on	N
a	N
card	N
taped	N
to	N
the	N
side	N
of	N
the	N
bookshelf	N
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
for	N
my	N
call	N
number	N
on	N
the	N
printed	N
cards	N
on	N
the	N
side	N
of	N
the	N
bookshelves	N
,	N
then	N
searched	N
the	N
books	N
until	N
I	N
found	C
the	N
one	N
I	N
was	N
looking	N
for	N
.	N
	
I	N
brought	N
the	N
book	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
front	N
of	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
The	N
librarian	N
took	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
and	N
scanned	N
it	N
and	N
my	N
book	N
with	N
a	N
special	N
scanner	N
.	N
	
She	N
gave	N
me	N
a	N
piece	N
of	N
paper	N
inside	N
the	N
book	N
that	N
said	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
bring	N
it	N
back	N
within	N
2	N
weeks	N
.	N
	
I	N
brought	N
the	N
book	N
home	N
and	N
read	N
it	N
,	N
then	N
brought	N
it	N
back	N
to	N
the	N
librarian	N
.	N
	
Yesterday	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
to	N
see	N
if	N
they	N
had	N
the	N
new	N
Stephen	N
King	N
book	N
.	N
	
I	N
thought	N
it	N
might	N
be	N
already	N
checked	N
out	N
,	N
or	N
maybe	N
they	N
did	N
n't	N
have	N
it	N
yet	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
check	N
before	N
I	N
spent	N
the	N
money	N
on	N
a	N
hard-cover	N
copy	N
of	N
the	N
book	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
got	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
,	N
I	N
stopped	N
inside	N
the	N
doors	N
and	N
looked	N
around	N
for	N
a	N
few	N
seconds	N
and	N
just	N
took	N
in	N
the	N
sights	N
..	N
.	N
	
the	N
library	N
is	N
one	N
of	N
my	N
favorite	N
places	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
card	N
catalog	N
and	N
looked	N
up	N
the	N
book	N
and	N
,	N
sure	N
enough	N
,	N
the	N
library	N
had	N
two	N
copies	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
shelves	N
that	N
had	N
the	N
Stephen	N
King	N
books	N
and	N
,	N
to	N
my	N
great	N
surprise	N
and	N
pleasure	N
,	N
there	N
was	N
a	N
librarian	N
there	N
re-shelving	N
books	N
and	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
books	N
in	N
her	N
hand	N
was	N
the	N
new	N
Stephen	N
King	N
book	N
.	N
	
I	N
asked	N
her	N
if	N
I	N
could	N
have	N
it	N
and	N
after	N
she	N
handed	N
it	N
to	N
me	N
I	N
went	N
straight	N
to	N
the	N
check-out	N
desk	N
,	N
paid	N
a	N
twenty-five	N
cent	N
fine	N
I	N
had	N
from	N
an	N
overdue	N
book	N
several	N
weeks	N
before	N
and	N
checked	N
the	N
book	N
out	N
.	N
	
I	N
could	N
n't	N
wait	N
to	N
get	N
home	N
to	N
read	N
it	N
.	N
	
Why	N
buy	N
a	N
book	N
when	N
you	N
can	N
borrow	N
one	N
from	N
the	N
library	N
?	N
Your	N
local	N
library	N
has	N
a	N
wealth	C
of	N
resources	N
just	N
waiting	N
for	N
you	N
to	N
explore	N
.	N
	
Before	N
you	N
check	N
anything	N
out	N
,	N
you	N
will	N
need	N
a	N
library	N
card	N
.	N
	
Typically	N
,	N
you	N
will	N
need	N
to	N
prove	N
who	N
you	N
are	N
and	N
where	N
you	N
live	N
.	N
	
Your	N
drivers	N
license	N
will	N
probably	N
work	N
for	N
that	N
.	N
	
Go	N
to	N
your	N
local	N
library	N
and	N
get	N
a	N
card	N
.	N
	
Once	N
you	N
have	N
done	N
that	N
,	N
you	N
are	N
ready	N
to	N
check	N
things	N
out	N
!	N
The	N
library	N
is	N
divided	C
into	N
different	N

One	N

either	N

,	N
select	N
it	N

take	N
it	N

They	N
will	N
scan	C
your	N

and	N
let	N
you	N
take	N
the	N
book	N
home	N
for	N
a	N
week	N
or	N
two	N
!	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
to	N
borrow	N
a	N
book	N
I	N
needed	N
for	N
a	N
research	N
paper	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
inside	N
the	N
library	N
and	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
section	N
that	N
contained	N
the	N
type	N
of	N
books	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
do	N
my	N
research	N
on	N
.	N
	
After	N
finding	N
the	N
right	N
section	N
,	N
I	N
looked	N
through	N
the	N
selections	N
of	N
books	N
they	N
had	N
.	N
	
I	N
quicly	N
looked	N
through	N
a	N
few	N
of	N
the	N
books	N
to	N
see	N
what	N
type	N
of	N
information	N
they	N
had	N
.	N
	
After	N
finding	N
the	N
book	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
borrow	N
I	N
took	N
it	N
to	N
the	N
counter	C
so	N
I	N
could	N
check	N
it	N
out	N
and	N
borrow	N
it	N
for	N
a	N
few	N
days	C
.	N
	
At	N
the	N
counter	C
,	N
the	N
librarian	N
asked	N
for	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
the	N
library	N
card	N
out	N
of	N
my	N
wallet	N
and	N
gave	N
it	N
to	N
her	N
.	N
	
She	N
collected	N
my	N
information	N
and	N
gave	N
me	N
the	N
book	N
and	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
exited	N
the	N
library	N
and	N
took	N
the	N
book	N
home	N
.	N
	
I	N
am	N
glad	N
I	N
had	N
the	N
library	N
card	N
because	N
the	N
book	N
was	N
really	N
useful	N
for	N
helping	N
me	N
do	N
my	N
research	N
paper	N
.	N
	
I	N
love	N
reading	N
books	N
,	N
and	N
once	N
I	N
finished	N
all	N
my	N
books	N
in	N
the	N
library	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
that	N
I	N
needed	N
new	N
books	N
.	N
	
The	N
best	N
place	N
in	N
my	N
neighborhood	N
for	N
getting	N
new	N
books	N
for	N
free	N
was	N
the	N
local	N
library	N
.	N
	
To	N
borrow	N
from	N
the	N
library	N
,	N
all	N
you	N
needed	N
was	N
a	N
simple	N
library	N
card	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
local	N
library	N
and	N
went	N
to	N
my	N
favorite	N
section	N
of	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
The	N
history	N
section	N
had	N
my	N
favorite	N
books	N
about	N
Napoleon	N

Once	N
I	N
found	C
my	N
favorite	N
book	N

I	N
took	N
it	N
with	N
me	N
and	N
brought	N
it	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
check	N
outline	C
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
in	N
line	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
my	N
turn	N
.	N
	
I	N
gave	N
the	N
librarian	N
my	N
book	N
and	N
library	N
card	N
and	N
they	N
checked	N
it	N
out	N
for	N
me	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
given	N
a	N
receipt	N
and	N
a	N
date	N
to	N
return	N
the	N
book	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
three	N
weeks	N
to	N
finish	N
the	N
book	N
before	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
go	N
back	N
and	N
return	N
it	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
left	N
the	N
library	N
,	N
the	N
security	N
checked	N
my	N
receipt	N
and	N
my	N
books	N
and	N
allowed	N
me	N
to	N
leave	N
.	N
	
The	N
library	N
has	N
so	N
many	N
books	N
to	N
choose	N
from	N
,	N
it	N
's	N
hard	N
to	N
decide	N
which	N
one	N
to	N
borrow	N
.	N
	
Looking	N
around	N
at	N
all	N
the	N
shelves	N
of	N
books	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
I	N
wanted	N
an	N
adventure	N
book	N
.	N
	
The	N
librarian	N
was	N
nice	N
enough	N
to	N
help	N
me	N
look	N
for	N
a	N
good	N
book	N
to	N
borrow	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
on	N
a	N
pirate	N
adventure	N
book	N
.	N
	
But	N
before	N
I	N
could	N
borrow	N
it	N
,	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
library	N
card	N
.	N
	
Again	N
,	N
the	N
librarian	N
was	N
very	N
helpful	N
.	N
	
We	N
walked	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
counter	C
,	N
and	N
she	N
helped	N
me	N
sign	N
up	N
for	N
a	N
library	N
card	N
.	N
	
All	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
do	N
was	N
tell	N
her	N
a	N
few	N
things	N
like	N
my	N
name	N
and	N
my	N
address	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
had	N
my	N
very	N
own	N
library	N
card	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
had	N
that	N
,	N
it	N
was	N
easy	N
to	N
check	N
out	N
the	N
book	N
.	N
	
She	N
scanned	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
,	N
punched	N
some	N
buttons	N
on	N
her	N
computer	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
book	N
was	N
mine	N
to	N
borrow	N
.	N
	
I	N
'll	N
be	N
sure	N
to	N
bring	N
it	N
back	N
in	N
a	N
few	N
days	C
so	N
I	N
do	N
n't	N
have	N
to	N
pay	N
any	N
late	N
fees	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
sitting	N
at	N
home	N
thinking	N
about	N
a	N
particular	C
book	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
been	N
wanting	N
to	N
read	N
so	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
get	N
in	N
my	N
car	N
and	N
drive	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
parked	N
my	N
car	N
in	N
the	N
parking	N
lot	N
I	N
got	N
out	N
of	N
my	N
car	N
and	N
entered	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
Once	N
inside	N
the	N
library	N
I	N
went	N
up	N
the	N
stairs	N
of	N
the	N
library	N
to	N
the	N
second	N
floor	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
got	N
to	N
the	N
second	N
floor	N
I	N
browsed	N
around	N
the	N
aisles	N
until	N
I	N
found	C
the	N
book	N
that	N
I	N
was	N
looking	N
for	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
got	N
the	N
book	N
I	N
went	N
back	N
down	N
the	N
stairs	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
check-out	N
counter	C
and	N
gave	N
the	N
librarian	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
.	N
	
I	N
told	N
the	N
librarian	N
thank	N
you	N
after	N
she	N
checked	N
out	N
my	N
book	N
.	N
	
She	N
handed	N
me	N
the	N
book	N
and	N
a	N
receipt	N
and	N
told	N
me	N
you	N
're	N
welcome	N
.	N
	
I	N
left	N
the	N
library	N
and	N
got	N
into	N
my	N
car	N
and	N
drove	N
home	N
were	N
I	N
began	N
reading	N
the	N
book	N
I	N
'd	N
been	N
wanting	N
to	N
read	N
.	N
	
My	N
five	N
year	N
old	N
son	N
loves	N
to	N
read	N
books	N
,	N
so	N
today	N
we	N
both	N
decided	N
to	N
head	N
towards	N
the	N
library	N
to	N
pick	N
one	N
out	N
.	N
	
Before	N
leaving	N
the	N
house	N
I	N
made	N
sure	N
he	N
had	N
his	N
library	N
card	N
with	N
him	N
because	N
without	N
it	N
he	N
would	N
n't	N
be	N
able	C
to	N
borrow	N
a	N
book	N
.	N
	
When	N
we	N
entered	N
the	N
library	N
we	N
went	N
straight	N
towards	N
the	N
kid	N
section	N
.	N
	
There	N
were	N
thousands	C
of	N
books	N
to	N
choose	N
from	N
and	N
he	N
had	N
a	N
little	N
trouble	N
making	N
up	N
his	N
mind	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
we	N
found	C
a	N
book	N
about	N
the	N
different	N
type	N
of	N
sea	N
animals	N
in	N
the	N
ocean	N
.	N
	
He	N
was	N
very	N
excited	N
as	N
he	N
flipped	N
through	N
the	N
pages	N
of	N
the	N
book	N
.	N
	
When	N
he	N
decided	N
this	N
was	N
the	N
book	N
he	N
wanted	N
to	N
take	N
home	N
,	N
we	N
make	N
our	N
way	N
towards	N
the	N
librarian	N
.	N
	
She	N
greeted	N
us	N
with	N
a	N
friendly	N
hello	N
and	N
asked	N
my	N
son	N
for	N
his	N
library	N
card	N
.	N
	
She	N
scanned	N
the	N
card	N
and	N
book	N
then	N
handed	N
them	N
both	N
back	N
to	N
my	N
son	N
.	N
	
She	N
informed	N
us	N
when	N
the	N
book	N
was	N
due	N
back	N
and	N
we	N
both	N
thanked	N
her	N
and	N
wished	N
her	N
a	N
pleasant	N
day	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
I	N
had	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
with	N
me	N
before	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
Then	N
,	N
I	N
looked	N
on	N
the	N
computers	N
for	N
a	N
book	N
I	N
liked	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
n't	N
able	C
to	N
find	N
one	N
that	N
well	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
asked	N
a	N
librarian	N
for	N
advice	N
.	N
	
She	N
also	N
looked	N
in	N
the	N
catalog	N
and	N
asked	N
me	N
about	N
what	N
I	N
wanted	N
so	N
she	N
could	N
suggest	N
more	N
options	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
,	N
I	N
found	C
a	N
book	N
I	N
liked	N
.	N
	
I	N
told	N
the	N
librarian	N
I	N
wanted	N
that	N
one	N
,	N
and	N
she	N
wrote	N
down	N
the	N
title	N
,	N
author	N
,	N
and	N
dewey	N
decimal	N
number	N
.	N
	
We	N
went	N
along	N
the	N
bookshelves	N
until	N
we	N
found	C
the	N
correct	N
number	N
range	N
,	N
then	N
started	N
searching	N
the	N
shelves	N
by	N
the	N
author	N
's	N
last	N
name	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
the	N
book	N
and	N
took	N
it	N
to	N
the	N
counter	C
.	N
	
The	N
librarian	N
scanned	N
the	N
book	N
and	N
my	N
card	N
and	N
said	N
I	N
would	N
have	N
to	N
return	N
it	N
in	N
3	N
weeks	N
.	N
	
She	N
gave	N
me	N
a	N
receipt	N
.	N
	
I	N
thanked	N
her	N
and	N
noted	N
the	N
due	N
date	N
down	N
on	N
my	N
calendar	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
too	N
long	N
to	N
start	N
working	N
on	N
my	N
report	N
that	N
was	N
due	N
for	N
my	N
class	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
in	N
a	N
hurry	N
,	N
and	N
had	N
to	N
get	N
some	N
research	N
material	N
for	N
the	N
assignment	C
.	N
	
Sadly	C
,	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
requirements	N
for	N
this	N
report	N
was	N
to	N
have	N
a	N
couple	N
citations	N
from	N
a	N
book	N
instead	N
of	N
other	N
articles	N
that	N
can	N
easily	N
be	N
found	C
on	N
the	N
internet	N
.	N
	
After	N
an	N
hour	N
of	N
searching	N
for	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
,	N
I	N
found	C
it	N
at	N
last	N
and	N
head	N
out	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
arrived	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
ask	N
the	N
librarian	N
where	N
they	N
kept	N
such	C
books	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
while	N
since	N
I	N
have	N
been	N
in	N
there	N
.	N
	
After	N
finding	N
the	N
section	N
.	N
	
I	N
carefully	N
looked	N
through	N
the	N
books	N
that	N
caught	N
my	N
eye	N
and	N
picked	N
the	N
book	N
that	N
I	N
needed	N
for	N
my	N
report	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
librarian	N
,	N
and	N
borrowed	N
the	N
book	N
.	N
	
But	N
not	N
without	N
paying	N
an	N
old	N
book	N
fee	N
I	N
had	N
from	N
a	N
year	N
ago	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
paid	N
,	N
I	N
walked	N
out	N
with	N
the	N
book	N
in	N
hand	N
ready	N
to	N
do	N
some	N
research	N
.	N
	
I	N
am	N
an	N
avid	N
reader	N
so	N
I	N
am	N
always	N
on	N
the	N
lookout	N
for	N
the	N
next	N
best	N
story	N
of	N
nonfiction	N
!	N
My	N
buddy	N
,	N
Frank	N
,	N
told	N
me	N
about	N
the	N
new	N
library	N
that	N
was	N
opening	C
up	N
about	N
a	N
mile	N
away	N
from	N
my	N
house	N
and	N
I	N
thought	N
this	N
was	N
a	N
great	N
opportunity	N
to	N
be	N
able	C
to	N
borrow	N
some	N
free	N
books	N
!	N
I	N
drove	N
down	N
and	N
was	N
in	N
awe	C
at	N
how	N
big	N
the	N
place	N
was	N
.	N
	
As	N
I	N
stepped	N
inside	N
and	N
began	N
to	N
browse	C
I	N
realized	N
that	N
not	N
only	N
did	N
they	N
have	N
books	N
but	N
they	N
had	N
video	N
games	N
,	N
DVDs	N
,	N
and	N
music	N
you	N
could	N
rent	N
as	N
well	N
.	N
	
After	N
spending	C
about	N
half	N
an	N
hour	N
in	N
there	N
just	N
browsing	N
I	N
finally	N
came	N
upon	C
a	N
book	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
read	N
:	N
The	N
Hitchhikers	N
Guide	N
to	N
the	N
Galaxy	N
!	N
I	N
grabbed	N
the	N
book	N
and	N
went	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
counter	C
.	N
	
The	N
nice	N
librarian	N
said	N
that	N
I	N
would	N
first	N
have	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
library	N
card	N
so	N
I	N
could	N
rent	N
out	N
my	N
book	N
.	N
	
I	N
filled	N
out	N
the	N
paper	N
work	N
and	N
she	N
handed	N
me	N
a	N
shinny	N
new	N
library	N
card	N
!	N
I	N
rented	N
my	N
book	N
and	N
she	N
told	N
me	N
that	N
I	N
was	N
due	N
by	N
a	N
week	N
from	N
today	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
back	N
home	N
and	N
got	N
started	N
on	N
my	N
reading	N
adventure	N
.	N
	
A	N
few	N
months	N
ago	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
to	N
check	N
out	N
a	N
couple	N
of	N
books	N
.	N
	
Our	N
local	N
library	N
is	N
very	N
large	N
and	N
full	N
of	N
very	N
interesting	N
books	N
,	N
magazines	N
and	N
movies	N
.	N
	
Before	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
find	N
my	N
books	N
,	N
I	N
stopped	N
at	N
the	N
coffee	N
shop	N
in	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
I	N
ordered	N
a	N
coffee	N
and	N
a	N
blueberry	N
muffin	N
so	N
I	N
could	N
have	N
a	N
snack	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
finished	N
my	N
snack	N
,	N
I	N
began	N
to	N
look	N
for	N
my	N
books	N
.	N
	
I	N
used	N
the	N
library	N
's	N
computer	N
to	N
find	N
the	N
location	N
of	N
each	N
book	N
.	N
	
Finding	N
the	N
books	N
only	N
took	N
me	N
about	N
10	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
found	C
the	N
books	N
,	N
I	N
sat	N
down	N
in	N
a	N
comfortable	N
chair	N
that	N
was	N
next	N
to	N
a	N
lamp	N
.	N
	
I	N
began	N
reading	N
one	N
of	N
my	N
books	N
while	N
I	N
was	N
drinking	N
my	N
coffee	N
.	N
	
I	N
stayed	N
at	N
the	N
library	N
and	N
read	N
for	N
about	N
thirty	N
minutes	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
checkout	N
to	N
check	N
out	N
my	N
books	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
I	N
left	N
to	N
walk	N
home	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
borrow	N
some	N
books	N
from	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
and	N
started	N
looking	N
on	N
the	N
shelves	N
.	N
	
There	N
were	N
so	N
many	N
good	N
books	N
that	N
it	N
was	N
difficult	N
to	N
pick	N
out	N
just	N
a	N
few	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
used	N
the	N
library	N
's	N
computer	N
book	N
search	N
program	N
.	N
	
Eventually	C
I	N
chose	N
several	N
modern	N
plays	N
,	N
a	N
biography	N
,	N
and	N
a	N
book	N
on	N
ancient	N
Rome	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
these	N
books	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
librarian	N
's	N
desk	N
and	N
asked	N
if	N
I	N
could	N
check	N
them	N
out	N
.	N
	
She	N
said	N
yes	N
,	N
I	N
could	N
borrow	N
the	N
books	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
sign	N
up	N
for	N
a	N
library	N
card	N
.	N
	
I	N
filled	N
out	N
the	N
form	N
,	N
and	N
she	N
took	N
it	N
.	N
	
Then	N
she	N
made	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
and	N
gave	N
it	N
to	N
me	N
.	N
	
With	N
this	N
accomplished	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
check	N
out	N
my	N
books	N
.	N
	
She	N
put	N
a	N
card	N
in	N
each	N
one	N
with	N
a	N
date	N
stamped	N
on	N
it	N
.	N
	
This	N
was	N
the	N
date	N
the	N
books	N
were	N
due	N
to	N
be	N
returned	N
.	N
	
I	N
promised	N
to	N
return	N
them	N
on	N
time	N
and	N
took	N
the	N
books	N
home	N
to	N
read	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
the	N
day	N
off	N
today	N
so	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
relax	N
and	N
read	N
a	N
new	N
book	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
and	N
check	N
one	N
out	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
from	N
my	N
wallet	N
and	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
around	N
some	N
of	N
the	N
different	N
sections	N
in	N
the	N
library	N
and	N
found	C
a	N
book	N
in	N
the	N
fiction	N
section	N
that	N
looked	N
interesting	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
it	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
front	N
counter	C
and	N
handed	N
the	N
librarian	N
the	N
book	N
and	N
my	N
library	N
card	N
.	N
	
She	N
scanned	N
the	N
book	N
and	N
my	N
card	N
,	N
told	N
me	N
when	N
the	N
book	N
was	N
due	N
back	N
and	N
then	N
handed	N
the	N
card	N
and	N
the	N
book	N
back	N
to	N
me	N
.	N
	
On	N
the	N
way	N
out	N
,	N
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
bookmark	C
from	N
a	N
table	N
set	N
up	N
near	N
the	N
door	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
home	N
and	N
began	N
to	N
read	N
my	N
book	N
.	N
	
A	N
week	N
later	N
when	N
I	N
was	N
done	N
reading	N
it	N
,	N
I	N
returned	N
the	N
book	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
and	N
found	C
a	N
new	N
one	N
to	N
check	N
out	N
and	N
take	N
home	N
to	N
read	N
.	N
	
I	N
love	N
to	N
read	N
,	N
and	N
today	N
I	N
remembered	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
already	N
finished	N
my	N
last	N
mystery	N
novel	N
.	N
	
So	N
now	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
to	N
head	N
back	N
to	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
short	N
walk	N
,	N
but	N
one	N
I	N
enjoyed	N
as	N
I	N
considered	N
what	N
kind	N
of	N
stories	N
I	N
would	N
check	N
out	N
next	N
.	N
	
I	N
dropped	N
my	N
return	N
books	N
into	N
the	N
slot	C
at	N
the	N
entrance	N
,	N
and	N
entered	N
the	N
library	N
.	N
	
Oh	N
how	N
I	N
love	N
the	N
smell	N
of	N
books	N
!	N
I	N
made	N
my	N
way	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
fiction	N
area	N
,	N
and	N
randomly	C
layed	N
eyes	N
on	N
the	N
book	N
bindings	N
,	N
until	N
a	N
title	N
would	N
catch	N
my	N
eye	N
.	N
	
After	N
2	N
to	N
3	N
more	N
,	N
I	N
would	N
take	N
my	N
selections	N
to	N
the	N
check	N
out	N
desk	N
.	N
	
The	N
librarian	N
,	N
who	N
knows	N
me	N
well	N
,	N
smiled	N
and	N
noted	N
the	N
books	N
I	N
had	N
chosen	N
in	N
the	N
system	N
.	N
	
The	N
library	N
has	N
a	N
scanner	N
now	N
.	N
	
It	N
makes	N
the	N
check	N
out	N
process	C
so	N
much	N
faster	N
now	N
.	N
	
I	N
picked	N
up	N
the	N
books	N
on	N
the	N
other	N
side	N
,	N
placed	N
them	N
in	N
my	N
bag	N
,	N
and	N
stepped	N
out	N
into	N
the	N
autumn	N
air	N
.	N
	
I	N
traveled	N
by	N
train	N
to	N
a	N
visit	N
a	N
friend	N
who	N
lived	N
a	N
few	N
hours	N
from	N
me	N
.	N
	
I	N
planned	N
to	N
stay	N
overnight	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
packed	C
a	N
suitcase	N
to	N
take	N
with	N
me	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
arrived	N
at	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
ticket	N
counter	C
to	N
purchase	C
a	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
at	N
the	N
schedule	C
of	N
departing	N
trains	N
and	N
selected	N
the	N
time	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
leave	N
.	N
	
I	N
paid	N
for	N
my	N
ticket	N
and	N
waited	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
while	N
,	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
for	N
my	N
train	N
to	N
depart	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
front	N
of	N
the	N
train	N
with	N
other	N
passengers	N
.	N
	
I	N
carried	N
my	N
small	N
suitcase	N
with	N
me	N
.	N
	
The	N
conductor	C
took	N
my	N
ticket	N
,	N
stamped	N
it	N
,	N
and	N
handed	N
it	N
back	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
a	N
nice	N
seat	N
by	N
the	N
window	N
and	N
settled	N
in	N
for	N
the	N
ride	N
.	N
	
When	N
everyone	N
was	N
aboard	C
,	N
the	N
train	N
announcer	N
announced	N
that	N
we	N
'd	N
be	N
leaving	N
the	N
station	N
.	N
	
He	N
announced	N
where	N
we	N
were	N
leaving	N
from	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
final	N
destination	N
.	N
	
I	N
brought	N
a	N
book	N
with	N
me	N
to	N
read	N
,	N
and	N
some	N
snacks	N
in	N
case	N
I	N
got	N
hungry	N
.	N
	
As	N
the	N
train	N
traveled	N
,	N
I	N
watched	N
the	N
scenery	N
that	N
went	N
by	N
-	N
there	N
were	N
small	N
houses	N
and	N
fields	N
with	N
cows	N
.	N
	
I	N
enjoyed	N
seeing	N
places	N
I	N
had	N
n't	N
seen	N
before	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
few	N
hours	N
I	N
arrived	N
.	N
	
My	N
friend	N
picked	N
me	N
up	N
at	N
the	N
station	N
and	N
we	N
drove	N
away	N
in	N
her	N
car	N
.	N
	
I	N
like	N
to	N
ride	N
on	N
trains	N
because	N
you	N
can	N
see	N
lots	N
of	N
countryside	N
without	N
having	N
to	N
worry	N
about	N
driving	N
.	N
	
One	N
time	N
,	N
when	N
I	N
lived	N
in	N
Alaska	N
,	N
I	N
rode	N
on	N
a	N
train	N
from	N
Fairbanks	N
to	N
Denali	N
park	N
.	N
	
Just	N
like	N
with	N
all	N
train	N
rides	N
,	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
buy	N
a	N
ticket	N
first	N
and	N
then	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
stand	N
in	N
line	N
to	N
wait	N
for	N
the	N
train	N
to	N
stop	N
at	N
the	N
station	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
climbed	N
onto	N
the	N
train	N
and	N
picked	N
a	N
seat	N
.	N
	
The	N
different	N
places	N
you	N
can	N
sit	N
in	N
a	N
train	N
are	N
called	N
cars	N
.	N
	
You	N
do	N
n't	N
have	N
assigned	N
seats	N
like	N
on	N
a	N
plane	N
and	N
the	N
seats	N
are	N
wide	N
for	N
more	N
than	N
one	N
person	N
to	N
sit	N
.	N
	
So	N
,	N
I	N
picked	N
one	N
in	N
a	N
car	N
in	N
the	N
back	N
and	N
sat	N
right	N
beside	N
the	N
window	N
.	N
	
After	N
the	N
train	N
started	N
moving	C
,	N
a	N
train	N
attendant	N
walked	N
through	N
to	N
check	N
our	N
tickets	N
and	N
then	N
I	N
stood	N
up	N
to	N
walk	N
around	N
.	N
	
You	N
can	N
walk	N
from	N
car	N
to	N
car	N
on	N
a	N
train	N
and	N
can	N
even	N
go	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
back	N
of	N
the	N
very	N
last	N
car	N
and	N
stand	N
outside	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
did	N
that	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
very	N
fun	N
to	N
be	N
standing	N
outside	N
while	N
the	N
train	N
was	N
moving	C
and	N
I	N
hung	N
onto	N
the	N
railing	N
to	N
be	N
sure	N
I	N
was	N
safe	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
went	N
back	N
inside	N
and	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
dining	N
car	N
where	N
I	N
bought	N
a	N
sandwich	N
and	N
water	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
got	N
back	N
to	N
my	N
seat	N
,	N
I	N
ate	N
and	N
watched	N
the	N
scenery	N
through	N
the	N
window	N
.	N
	
I	N
saw	N
lots	N
of	N
interesting	N
things	N
including	N
a	N
moose	N
and	N
we	N
arrived	N
at	N
Denali	N
right	N
after	N
that	N
.	N
	
I	N
bought	N
a	N
ticket	N
for	N
a	N
train	N
ride	N
to	N
the	N
city	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
I	N
was	N
at	N
the	N
station	N
at	N
least	N
15	N
minutes	N
early	N
so	N
that	N
I	N
would	N
not	N
miss	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
After	N
waiting	N
for	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
,	N
my	N
train	N
was	N
ready	N
to	N
be	N
boarded	N
.	N
	
I	N
lined	N
up	N
with	N
the	N
other	N
passengers	N
and	N
gave	N
my	N
ticket	N
to	N
the	N
lady	N
at	N
the	N
counter	C
.	N
	
We	N
all	N
boarded	N
the	N
train	N
in	N
an	N
orderly	N
fashion	N
and	N
waited	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
to	N
depart	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
n't	N
too	N
long	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
for	N
the	N
train	N
to	N
go	N
.	N
	
I	N
quietly	N
sat	N
by	N
the	N
window	N
seat	N
and	N
looked	N
at	N
the	N
great	N
scenery	N
outside	N
as	N
the	N
train	N
went	N
by	N
.	N
	
I	N
would	N
have	N
never	N
seen	N
some	N
of	N
the	N
scenery	N
had	N
I	N
not	N
taken	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
Before	N
I	N
knew	N
it	N
,	N
the	N
train	N
had	N
arrived	N
at	N
our	N
destination	N
in	N
the	N
city	N
.	N
	
I	N
am	N
glad	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
train	N
this	N
time	N
because	N
I	N
enjoyed	N
it	N
.	N
	
Recently	N
,	N
I	N
traveled	N
to	N
Southern	N
California	N
to	N
visit	N
a	N
friend	N
of	N
mine	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
suggested	N
to	N
me	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
train	N
down	N
south	N
as	N
it	N
is	N
cheaper	N
than	N
driving	N
and	N
flying	N
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
up	N
the	N
available	N
routes	N
and	N
price	N
on	N
the	N
internet	N
and	N
found	C
a	N
ticket	N
for	N
a	N
fairly	N
cheap	N
price	N
.	N
	
I	N
purchased	N
it	N
and	N
was	N
very	N
excited	N
at	N
how	N
much	N
money	N
I	N
was	N
saving	C
.	N
	
I	N
packed	C
my	N
iPad	N
and	N
made	N
sure	N
all	N
of	N
my	N
electronic	N
items	N
were	N
charged	N
and	N
drove	N
to	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
.	N
	
I	N
waited	N
about	N
30	N
minutes	N
for	N
the	N
train	N
and	N
carefully	N
boarded	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
stepped	N
on	N
the	N
to	N
the	N
train	N
that	N
was	N
n't	N
very	N
crowded	N
and	N
found	C
a	N
comfortable	N
window	N
seat	N
next	N
to	N
an	N
old	N
man	N
.	N
	
I	N
stared	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
and	N
read	N
a	N
book	N
on	N
my	N
iPad	N
for	N
most	N
of	N
the	N
trip	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
very	N
pleasant	N
ride	N
.	N
	
When	N
we	N
arrived	N
at	N
the	N
destination	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
off	N
of	N
the	N
train	N
and	N
called	N
my	N
friend	N
to	N
pick	N
me	N
up	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
fun	N
ride	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
excited	N
because	N
I	N
was	N
finally	N
going	N
to	N
visit	N
my	N
friends	N
in	N
Long	N
Island	N
.	N
	
Whenever	N
I	N
thought	N
about	N
Long	N
Island	N
,	N
I	N
always	N
thought	N
about	N
Great	N
Gatsby	N
and	N
the	N
wonderful	N
homes	N
that	N
surrounded	N
that	N
area	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
day	N
came	N
to	N
visit	N
them	N
,	N
I	N
boarded	N
a	N
subway	C
train	N
to	N
Penn	N
Station	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
arrived	N
at	N
Penn	N
Station	N
,	N
I	N
looked	N
for	N
a	N
machine	N
that	N
sold	N
tickets	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
a	N
machine	N
and	N
bought	N
a	N
one	N
way	N
train	N
ride	N
to	N
Montauk	N
.	N
	
It	N
costed	N
me	N
about	N
10	N
dollars	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
bought	N
the	N
ticket	N
,	N
I	N
looked	N
at	N
the	N
schedule	C
board	N
on	N
the	N
wall	N
to	N
see	N
when	N
my	N
train	N
would	N
arrive	N
and	N
what	N
track	N
number	N
it	N
was	N
located	N
on	N
.	N
	
It	N
said	N
that	N
the	N
train	N
was	N
arriving	N
in	N
2	N
minutes	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
track	N
number	N
was	N
16	N
.	N
	
I	N
found	C
track	N
number	N
16	N
and	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
train	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N
	
Once	N
it	N
did	N
,	N
I	N
simply	C
waited	N
for	N
the	N
doors	N
to	N
open	N
and	N
got	N
on	N
.	N
	
The	N
seats	N
were	N
super	N
comfortable	N
and	N
I	N
found	C
a	N
empty	N
seat	N
by	N
the	N
window	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
train	N
started	N
moving	C
,	N
a	N
conductor	C
came	N
around	N
collecting	N
our	N
tickets	N
.	N
	
Someone	N
forgot	N
to	N
buy	N
a	N
ticket	N
and	N
had	N
to	N
pay	N
extra	N
money	N
to	N
buy	N
one	N
.	N
	
Apparently	C
,	N
tickets	N
are	N
more	N
expensive	N
on	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
reached	N
my	N
destination	N
after	N
1	N
hour	N
,	N
I	N
finally	N
got	N
off	N
and	N
went	N
off	N
to	N
visit	N
my	N
friends	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
very	N
excited	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
a	N
train	N
trip	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
ticket	N
counter	C
and	N
gave	N
the	N
teller	N
the	N
money	N
I	N
had	N
saved	N
for	N
my	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
I	N
could	N
hardly	N
wait	N
until	N
the	N
train	N
finally	N
arrived	N
.	N
	
I	N
climbed	N
aboard	C
,	N
put	N
my	N
suitcases	N
next	N
to	N
all	N
the	N
other	N
people	N
's	N
suitcases	N
,	N
and	N
found	C
a	N
seat	N
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
train	N
started	N
going	N
,	N
the	N
conductor	C
came	N
by	N
to	N
punch	C
everyone	N
's	N
tickets	N
.	N
	
I	N
gladly	N
handed	N
him	N
mine	N
to	N
be	N
punched	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
I	N
would	N
get	N
some	N
lunch	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
back	N
of	N
the	N
train	N
to	N
the	N
lunch	N
car	N
and	N
ordered	N
some	N
food	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
fun	N
to	N
eat	N
while	N
watching	N
the	N
world	N
pass	N
by	N
through	N
the	N
window	N
as	N
the	N
train	N
rolled	N
down	N
the	N
tracks	N
.	N
	
Before	N
I	N
knew	N
it	N
,	N
we	N
had	N
arrived	N
at	N
the	N
destination	N
.	N
	
I	N
gathered	N
up	N
my	N
things	N
,	N
grabbed	N
my	N
suitcase	N
,	N
and	N
climbed	N
down	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
train	N
as	N
the	N
conductor	C
gave	N
me	N
a	N
hand	N
.	N
	
It	N
had	N
been	N
a	N
very	N
fun	N
trip	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
ca	N
n't	N
wait	N
to	N
ride	N
again	N
.	N
	
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
trip	N
to	N
Washington	N
DC	N
to	N
visit	N
the	N
monuments	N
.	N
	
The	N
quickest	N
and	N
cheapest	N
way	N
seemed	N
to	N
be	N
by	N
train	N
.	N
	
I	N
purchased	N
a	N
ticket	N
online	N
and	N
had	N
a	N
friend	N
drop	N
me	N
at	N
the	N
station	N
.	N
	
Once	N
at	N
the	N
station	N
I	N
gave	N
my	N
ticket	N
to	N
the	N
agent	C
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
went	N
and	N
sat	N
in	N
the	N
lobby	C
to	N
wait	N
for	N
it	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
train	N
arrived	N
I	N
boarded	N
and	N
took	N
my	N
seat	N
next	N
to	N
a	N
window	N
.	N
	
The	N
ride	N
would	N
take	N
a	N
few	N
hours	N
so	N
I	N
settled	N
in	N
with	N
a	N
book	N
.	N
	
I	N
enjoyed	N
watching	N
the	N
countryside	N
pass	N
when	N
I	N
got	N
bored	N
with	N
the	N
book	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
bathroom	N
I	N
could	N
n't	N
get	N
the	N
door	N
to	N
bolt	N
shut	N
all	N
the	N
way	N
.	N
	
the	N
train	N
braked	N
and	N
the	N
door	N
slid	N
open	N
and	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
stand	N
to	N
re-shut	N
it	N
.	N
	
A	N
passenger	N
next	N
to	N
the	N
restroom	N
saw	N
my	N
butt	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
embarrasing	N
and	N
I	N
did	N
n't	N
leave	N
my	N
seat	N
for	N
the	N
rest	N
of	N
the	N
ride	N
until	N
we	N
got	N
to	N
DC	N
.	N
	
Today	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
visit	N
one	N
of	N
my	N
friends	N
that	N
I	N
have	N
n't	N
seen	N
in	N
a	N
very	N
long	N
time	N
.	N
	
They	N
just	N
moved	N
into	N
a	N
new	N
apartment	N
and	N
they	N
invited	N
me	N
over	N
.	N
	
They	N
gave	N
me	N
their	N
address	N
but	N
I	N
was	N
n't	N
sure	N
how	N
to	N
get	N
there	N
by	N
train	N
.	N
	
The	N
first	N
thing	N
I	N
did	N
when	N
I	N
got	N
to	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
was	N
see	N
what	N
train	N
goes	N
to	N
their	N
neighborhood	N
.	N
	
After	N
I	N
figured	N
that	N
out	N
,	N
I	N
made	N
sure	N
I	N
had	N
enough	N
money	N
on	N
my	N
metro	N
card	N
to	N
pay	N
the	N
train	N
fare	N
.	N
	
After	N
going	N
through	N
the	N
turnstile	N
I	N
waited	N
on	N
the	N
train	N
platform	N
for	N
the	N
train	N
to	N
enter	N
the	N
station	N
.	N
	
I	N
quickly	N
found	C
a	N
seat	N
on	N
the	N
train	N
since	N
not	N
to	N
many	N
people	N
were	N
on	N
it	N
.	N
	
After	N
about	N
25	N
minutes	N
I	N
finally	N
arrived	N
at	N
the	N
stop	N
I	N
was	N
supposed	N
to	N
get	N
off	N
at	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
up	N
the	N
stairs	N
and	N
exited	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
and	N
walked	N
2	N
blocks	N
away	N
to	N
where	N
my	N
friend	N
lives	N
.	N
	
He	N
was	N
happy	N
to	N
see	N
me	N
.	N
	
I	N
ordered	N
my	N
train	N
tickets	N
a	N
couple	N
days	C
before	N
after	N
planning	C
to	N
meet	N
up	N
with	N
family	N
.	N
	
I	N
had	N
them	N
printed	N
out	N
and	N
ready	N
to	N
use	N
.	N
	
After	N
doing	N
the	N
standard	C
morning	N
routines	N
,	N
we	N
finally	N
arrived	N
at	N
train	N
station	N
about	N
half	N
an	N
hour	N
early	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
that	N
we	N
got	N
there	N
in	N
time	N
.	N
	
We	N
approached	N
the	N
clerk	N
desk	N
to	N
get	N
confirmation	C
about	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
After	N
about	N
half	N
an	N
hour	N
later	N
,	N
the	N
train	N
arrived	N
very	N
shortly	C
after	N
we	N
sat	N
down	N
.	N
	
We	N
both	N
showed	N
the	N
tickets	N
to	N
the	N
employee	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
got	N
on	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
We	N
both	N
got	N
seated	N
into	N
our	N
seats	N
with	N
our	N
luggage	N
being	N
handled	N
.	N
	
It	N
did	N
not	N
take	N
for	N
the	N
train	N
to	N
take	N
off	N
,	N
and	N
we	N
were	N
on	N
our	N
way	N
.	N
	
While	N
the	N
train	N
ride	N
was	N
pretty	N
uncomfortable	N
,	N
the	N
sights	N
was	N
enjoyable	N
.	N
	
The	N
ride	N
took	N
about	N
a	N
couple	N
hours	N
until	N
we	N
arrived	N
at	N
our	N
destination	N
.	N
	
We	N
both	N
got	N
our	N
luggage	N
and	N
got	N
off	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
to	N
look	N
up	N
the	N
train	N
schedule	C
in	N
advance	C
to	N
make	N
sure	N
I	N
knew	N
which	N
train	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
check	N
.	N
	
Then	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
a	N
day	N
early	N
to	N
purchase	C
my	N
tickets	N
to	N
made	N
sure	N
I	N
had	N
them	N
,	N
since	N
this	N
was	N
not	N
a	N
trip	N
I	N
made	N
every	N
day	N
.	N
	
On	N
the	N
day	N
of	N
my	N
trip	N
,	N
I	N
checked	N
the	N
schedule	C
to	N
make	N
sure	N
there	N
were	N
no	N
delays	N
or	N
cancellations	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
to	N
arrive	N
at	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
at	N
least	N
10	N
minutes	N
early	N
,	N
with	N
all	N
my	N
bags	N
and	N
luggage	N
.	N
	
I	N
boarded	N
the	N
train	N
and	N
greeted	N
the	N
conductor	C
and	N
showed	N
him	N
my	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
Then	N
,	N
I	N
picked	N
a	N
spot	N
that	N
was	N
open	N
and	N
sat	N
down	N
quietly	N
.	N
	
Since	N
this	N
train	N
had	N
many	N
stops	N
,	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
be	N
aware	C
of	N
when	N
my	N
stop	N
was	N
coming	N
up	N
so	N
I	N
would	N
not	N
miss	N
it	N
.	N
	
As	N
my	N
stop	N
approached	N
,	N
I	N
pressed	N
the	N
stop	N
request	N
button	N
and	N
started	N
to	N
get	N
up	N
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
train	N
stopped	N
,	N
I	N
wished	N
the	N
conductor	C
a	N
nice	N
day	N
and	N
got	N
off	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
My	N
family	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
train	N
in	N
to	N
the	N
city	N
and	N
have	N
an	N
afternoon	N
of	N
shopping	N
.	N
	
We	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
station	N
and	N
bought	N
tickets	N
from	N
the	N
vending	N
machine	N
there	N
.	N
	
We	N
often	N
bought	N
the	N
ten-trip	N
ticket	N
because	N
it	N
was	N
a	N
good	N
bargain	C
.	N
	
Then	N
we	N
had	N
to	N
wait	N
for	N
our	N
train	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N
	
When	N
it	N
did	N
,	N
we	N
stepped	N
through	N
the	N
open	N
doors	N
into	N
the	N
car	N
,	N
stepping	N
carefully	N
over	N
the	N
gap	N
between	N
the	N
platform	N
and	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
We	N
found	C
ourselves	N
a	N
nice	N
seat	N
.	N
	
My	N
sister	N
took	N
a	N
seat	N
by	N
the	N
window	N
because	N
she	N
always	N
likes	N
to	N
watch	N
the	N
moving	C
landscape	N
.	N
	
We	N
all	N
enjoyed	N
a	N
train	N
ride	N
.	N
	
The	N
sound	N
of	N
the	N
wheels	N
on	N
the	N
tracks	N
was	N
soothing	C
and	N
the	N
rides	N
were	N
n't	N
too	N
long	N
.	N
	
Before	N
long	N
,	N
the	N
conductor	C
came	N
and	N
took	N
our	N
tickets	N
.	N
	
She	N
was	N
very	N
polite	N
and	N
friendly	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
not	N
long	N
before	N
the	N
train	N
went	N
into	N
the	N
tunnel	N
and	N
we	N
knew	N
the	N
ride	N
was	N
nearly	N
over	N
.	N
	
Last	N
month	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
visit	N
my	N
grandmother	N
.	N
	
She	N
lives	N
about	N
three	N
hours	N
away	N
from	N
me	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
do	N
not	N
own	N
a	N
car	N
.	N
	
To	N
get	N
to	N
her	N
house	N
safely	N
,	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
train	N
.	N
	
Trains	N
are	N
a	N
very	N
affordable	C
way	N
to	N
travel	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
find	N
them	N
to	N
be	N
comfortable	N
and	N
pleasant	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
on	N
my	N
computer	N
,	N
and	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
website	N
where	N
people	N
buy	N
train	N
tickets	N
.	N
	
I	N
chose	N
a	N
date	N
to	N
leave	N
and	N
I	N
booked	N
my	N
tickets	N
.	N
	
My	N
tickets	N
were	N
emailed	N
to	N
me	N
and	N
I	N
printed	N
them	N
off	N
using	N
my	N
printer	N
.	N
	
A	N
week	N
later	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
and	N
boarded	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
The	N
ride	N
was	N
very	N
quiet	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
nap	C
part	N
of	N
the	N
ride	N
.	N
	
The	N
seats	N
were	N
very	N
comfortable	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
cafeteria	N
cart	N
on	N
the	N
train	N
and	N
bought	N
coffee	N
.	N
	
I	N
enjoyed	N
the	N
coffee	N
and	N
drank	N
it	N
while	N
looking	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
.	N
	
I	N
really	N
enjoyed	N
the	N
whole	N
experience	N
.	N
	
I	N
entered	N
the	N
train	N
depot	N
and	N
went	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
window	N
.	N
	
I	N
asked	N
for	N
a	N
ticket	N
to	N
Chicago	N
.	N
	
I	N
paid	N
for	N
it	N
and	N
clerk	N
gave	N
me	N
my	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
The	N
train	N
was	N
already	N
boarding	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
went	N
directly	N
to	N
the	N
platform	N
and	N
boarded	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
down	N
the	N
aisle	N
and	N
found	C
an	N
empty	N
seat	N
.	N
	
The	N
train	N
pulled	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
station	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
,	N
the	N
conductor	C
came	N
by	N
and	N
checked	N
my	N
ticket	N
,	N
punching	N
it	N
with	N
a	N
small	N
hole	N
punch	C
.	N
	
I	N
looked	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
.	N
	
People	N
's	N
houses	N
and	N
huge	N
warehouses	N
passed	N
by	N
.	N
	
Later	N
,	N
as	N
we	N
got	N
into	N
the	N
country	N
,	N
I	N
saw	N
a	N
cow	N
or	N
two	N
.	N
	
After	N
about	N
a	N
half	N
hour	N
we	N
pulled	N
into	N
the	N
station	N
in	N
Chicago	N
.	N
	
The	N
train	N
pulled	N
and	N
stopped	N
rather	N
suddenly	N
,	N
throwing	N
me	N
forward	N
a	N
bit	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
up	N
and	N
went	N
down	N
the	N
aisle	N
and	N
exited	N
the	N
train	N
,	N
stepping	N
down	N
to	N
the	N
platform	N
and	N
exiting	N
the	N
station	N
.	N
	
Windy	N
City	N
,	N
here	N
I	N
come	N
!	N
Last	N
week	N
I	N
traveled	N
on	N
a	N
train	N
to	N
see	N
my	N
brother	N
.	N
	
When	N
my	N
brother	N
's	N
pregnant	N
wife	N
gave	N
birth	N
to	N
their	N
baby	N
I	N
was	N
excited	N
to	N
see	N
them	N
and	N
their	N
new	N
addition	C
to	N
the	N
family	N
.	N
	
They	N
lived	N
500	N
miles	C
away	N
in	N
Charlotte	N
,	N
North	N
Carolina	N
.	N
	
The	N
cheapest	N
option	N
was	N
to	N
catch	N
a	N
train	N
to	N
go	N
see	N
them	N
.	N
	
I	N
arrived	N
at	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
and	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
ticket	N
desk	N
.	N
	
He	N
asked	N
me	N
where	N
I	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
go	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
told	N
him	N
where	N
and	N
why	N
.	N
	
He	N
was	N
happy	N
to	N
assist	C
me	N
.	N
	
He	N
pointed	N
me	N
in	N
the	N
direction	N
to	N
the	N
correct	N
platform	N
where	N
my	N
train	N
would	N
departure	N
from	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
got	N
to	N
the	N
platform	N
,	N
the	N
train	N
was	N
waiting	N
for	N
me	N
.	N
	
I	N
handed	N
the	N
attendant	N
my	N
ticket	N
and	N
got	N
on	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
Now	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
to	N
put	N
my	N
feet	N
back	N
and	N
relax	N
.	N
	
In	N
just	N
a	N
few	N
short	N
hours	N
,	N
I	N
arrived	N
in	N
Charlotte	N
,	N
North	N

was	N
off	N
to	N
see	N
my	N
new	N

Today	N
I	N
am	N
going	N

We	N
are	N
going	N
to	N
visit	N
for	N
my	N
birthday	N

We	N
left	N
our	N
home	N
and	N
drove	N
in	N
our	N
car	N
to	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
.	N
	
We	N
then	N
went	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
counter	C
and	N
bought	N
two	N
tickets	N
to	N
ride	N
the	N
train	N
to	N
my	N
grandmother	N
's	N
town	N

We	N
had	N
to	N
wait	N
for	N

minutes	N
in	N
the	N
station	N
before	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
to	N
board	N

When	N

saw	N
many	N
interesting	N
things	N
on	N
our	N
way	N
to	N
see	N
my	N
grandmother	N
.	N
	
The	N
train	N
moved	N
very	N
fast	N
along	N
the	N
tracks	N
.	N
	
We	N
arrived	N
at	N
our	N
destination	N
quickly	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
train	N
pulled	N
into	N
the	N
station	N
,	N
we	N
saw	N
my	N
grandmother	N
waiting	N
there	N
for	N
us	N
!	N
On	N
the	N
weekend	N
I	N
caught	N
the	N
train	N
into	N
the	N
city	N
.	N
	
Before	N
I	N
left	N
my	N
house	N
in	N
the	N
morning	N
,	N
I	N
checked	N
the	N
train	N
timetable	N
online	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
.	N
	
At	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
ticket	N
booth	N
and	N
asked	N
for	N
one	N
return	N
ticket	N
to	N
where	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
go	N
.	N
	
I	N
paid	N
the	N
man	N
at	N
the	N
booth	N
and	N
he	N
gave	N
me	N
my	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
sat	N
down	N
on	N
a	N
bench	C
on	N
the	N
train	N
platform	N
and	N
waited	N
for	N
my	N
train	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N
	
Five	N
minutes	N
later	N
,	N
the	N
train	N
arrived	N
.	N
	
I	N
stood	N
up	N
and	N
got	N
on	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
On	N
the	N
train	N
,	N
I	N
found	C
an	N
empty	N
seat	N
and	N
sat	N
down	N
.	N
	
I	N
pulled	N
a	N
book	N
out	N
of	N
my	N
bag	N
and	N
read	N
it	N
while	N
I	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
train	N
to	N
arrive	N
at	N
my	N
stop	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
train	N
conductor	C
announced	N
that	N
the	N
train	N
had	N
reached	N
my	N
stop	N
,	N
I	N
stood	N
up	N
and	N
exited	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
I	N
needed	N
to	N
visit	N
my	N
Grandma	N
upstate	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
train	N
.	N
	
I	N
purchased	N
my	N
tickets	N
online	N
and	N
printed	N
out	N
a	N
receipt	N
.	N
	
I	N
packed	C
a	N
bag	N
.	N
	
The	N
next	N
day	N
,	N
I	N
headed	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
and	N
checked	N
in	N
at	N
the	N
ticket	N
counter	C
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
early	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
picked	N
a	N
spot	N
on	N
a	N
bench	C
and	N
sat	N
down	N
.	N
	
After	N
a	N
short	N
while	N
,	N
everybody	N
lined	N
up	N
to	N
get	N
on	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
A	N
train	N
worker	N
checked	N
all	N
of	N
our	N
tickets	N
.	N
	
I	N
entered	N
the	N
train	N
and	N
picked	N
out	N
a	N
seat	N
for	N
myself	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
loaded	N
my	N
bag	N
overhead	N
.	N
	
Once	N
everyone	N
was	N
on	N
the	N
train	N
,	N
our	N
conductor	C
announced	N
that	N
we	N
were	N
leaving	N
the	N
station	N
.	N
	
Another	N
train	N
worker	N
came	N
around	N
and	N
took	N
everyone	N
's	N
tickets	N
from	N
them	N
.	N
	
I	N
spent	N
the	N
ride	N
looking	N
at	N
scenery	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
and	N
reading	N
mostly	N
.	N
	
Eventually	C
,	N
the	N
train	N
conductor	C
announced	N
my	N
stop	N
.	N
	
I	N
retrieved	N
my	N
bag	N
from	N
the	N
overhead	N
compartment	N
,	N
and	N
headed	N
downstairs	N
and	N
off	N
of	N
the	N
train	N
.	N
	
I	N
needed	N
to	N
travel	N
across	N
the	N
state	C
,	N
and	N
the	N
train	N
was	N
the	N
quickest	N
and	N
most	N
efficient	N
way	N
to	N
do	N
that	N
as	N
my	N
car	N
is	N
unable	N
to	N
make	N
a	N
long	N
trip	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
online	N
to	N
the	N
Amtrak	N
website	N
and	N
checked	N
the	N
schedule	C
and	N
prices	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
made	N
a	N
reservation	N
.	N
	
A	N
friend	N
gave	N
me	N
a	N
lift	N
to	N
the	N
depot	N
and	N
once	N
there	N
I	N
purchased	N
my	N
ticket	N
and	N
then	N
boarded	N
the	N
train	N
when	N
it	N
arrived	N
on	N
time	N
.	N
	
I	N
brought	N
my	N
small	N
suitcase	N
onboard	N
with	N
me	N
and	N
did	N
not	N
need	N
to	N
check	N
any	N
other	N
bags	N
.	N
	
The	N
train	N
ride	N
was	N
comfortable	N
and	N
not	N
crowded	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
had	N
my	N
own	N
seat	N
.	N
	
There	N
were	N
no	N
delays	N
on	N
the	N
tracks	N
and	N
my	N
carriage	C
had	N
only	N
mature	C
adults	N
who	N
were	N
peaceful	N
and	N
quiet	N
,	N
so	N
it	N
was	N
a	N
pleasant	N
and	N
quiet	N
journey	N
.	N
	
I	N
visited	N
the	N
dining	N
car	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
snack	N
and	N
though	N
it	N
was	N
expensive	N
it	N
was	N
well	N
stocked	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
bought	N
a	N
coffee	N
and	N
a	N
turkey	N
sandwich	N
.	N
	
My	N
arrival	N
was	N
on	N
time	N
and	N
I	N
disembarked	N
.	N
	
Yesterday	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
visit	N
my	N
sister	N
who	N
lives	N
a	N
few	N
towns	N
away	N
.	N
	
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
train	N
because	N
it	N
is	N
cheaper	N
than	N
putting	N
gas	N
in	N
my	N
car	N
.	N
	
So	N
I	N
drove	N
to	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
and	N
parked	N
my	N
car	N
in	N
the	N
parking	N
lot	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
cashier	N
's	N
window	N
and	N
waited	N
in	N
line	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
reached	N
the	N
front	N
of	N
the	N
line	N
,	N
I	N
greeted	N
the	N
cashier	N
and	N
bought	N
a	N
train	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
I	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
train	N
platform	N
and	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
train	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
train	N
finally	N
arrived	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
on	N
the	N
train	N
and	N
located	N
my	N
seat	N
,	N
which	N
was	N
printed	N
on	N
my	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
I	N
sat	N
in	N
my	N
seat	N
and	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
magazine	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
brought	N
to	N
read	N
on	N
the	N
ride	N
.	N
	
The	N
train	N
eventually	C
started	N
back	N
up	N
and	N
left	N
the	N
station	N
.	N
	
Before	N
long	N
,	N
a	N
ticket	N
taker	N
came	N
over	N
and	N
asked	N
for	N
my	N
ticket	N
to	N
verify	C
that	N
I	N
had	N
paid	N
for	N
my	N
ride	N
and	N
was	N
in	N
the	N
correct	N
seat	N
.	N
	
I	N
greeted	N
the	N
ticket	N
taker	N
and	N
gave	N
him	N
my	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
arrived	N
at	N
my	N
sister	N
's	N
city	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
off	N
the	N
train	N
and	N
she	N
was	N
there	N
to	N
meet	N
me	N
at	N
the	N
station	N
.	N
	
We	N
had	N
a	N
very	N
nice	N
visit	N
.	N
	
My	N
friend	N
and	N
I	N
set	N
aside	C
a	N
date	N
that	N
we	N
could	N
meet	N
each	N
other	N
.	N
	
She	N
lives	N
in	N
another	N
area	N
so	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
buy	N
a	N
train	N
ticket	N
.	N
	
Since	N
we	N
planned	N
the	N
trip	N
early	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
save	N
a	N
little	N
bit	N
of	N
money	N
.	N
	
The	N
trip	N
would	N
n't	N
be	N
for	N
another	N
two	N
weeks	N
.	N
	
I	N
bought	N
the	N
tickets	N
online	N
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
day	N
finally	N
came	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
cab	N
to	N
the	N
train	N
station	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
n't	N
very	N
far	N
.	N
	
Once	N
,	N
inside	N
the	N
station	N
,	N
I	N
checked	N
the	N
displays	N
for	N
any	N
signs	N
of	N
my	N
train	N
being	N
late	N
.	N
	
Today	N
,	N
there	N
were	N
n't	N
any	N
.	N
	
About	N
fifteen	N
minutes	N
later	N
,	N
my	N
train	N
showed	N
up	N
and	N
I	N
got	N
on	N
board	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
crowded	N
but	N
not	N
as	N
much	N
as	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
local	N
trains	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
to	N
listen	N
for	N
any	N
announcements	N
about	N
what	N
stops	N
we	N
were	N
arriving	N
at	N
so	N
I	N
'd	N
know	N
when	N
I	N
was	N
close	N
to	N
my	N
destination	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
,	N
the	N
train	N
arrived	N
at	N
my	N
destination	N
and	N
I	N
met	N
my	N
friend	N
just	N
outside	N
the	N
station	N
.	N
	
My	N
family	N
recently	N
moved	N
to	N
a	N
new	N
home	N
with	N
a	N
bland	C
and	N
boring	N
yard	N
.	N
	
We	N
decided	N
to	N
plant	N
some	N
trees	N
to	N
spice	N
up	N
the	N
place	N
,	N
so	N
my	N
mother	N
,	N
father	N
,	N
siblings	N
and	N
I	N
all	N
packed	C
ourselves	N
into	N
the	N
SUV	N
and	N
drove	N
to	N
a	N
nearby	N
nursery	C
.	N
	
We	N
looked	N
at	N
many	N
different	N
types	N
of	N
trees	N
before	N
settling	N
on	N
the	N
apple	N
trees	N
.	N
	
We	N
bought	N
several	N
baby	N
apple	N
trees	N
and	N
took	N
them	N
home	N
for	N
planting	N
.	N
	
First	N
,	N
my	N
father	N
and	N
older	N
brother	N
dug	N
large	N
holes	N
in	N
the	N
ground	N
.	N
	
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
help	N
,	N
but	N
they	N
said	N
I	N
was	N
too	N
young	N
to	N
hold	N
the	N
shovel	N
!	N
After	N
the	N
holes	N
were	N
dug	N
,	N
the	N
apple	N
trees	N
were	N
placed	N
inside	N
.	N
	
Then	N
,	N
we	N
shoveled	N
dirt	N
into	N
the	N
holes	N
to	N
fix	N
the	N
apple	N
trees	N
in	N
place	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
allowed	N
to	N
help	N
with	N
that	N
,	N
thankfully	C
.	N
	
After	N
all	N
that	N
,	N
our	N
baby	N
apple	N
trees	N
were	N
planted	N
in	N
the	N
ground	N
and	N
we	N
were	N
all	N
very	N
excited	N
to	N
see	N
what	N
they	N
would	N
look	N
like	N
as	N
they	N
grew	N
up	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
was	N
a	N
freshman	N
in	N
high	N
school	N
we	N
each	N
had	N
the	N
opportunity	N
to	N
buy	N
an	N
inexpensive	N
tree	N
as	N
part	N
of	N
the	N
Arbor	N
Day	N
holiday	N
.	N
	
Part	N
of	N
the	N
proceeds	N
for	N
the	N
purchase	C
were	N
going	N
to	N
plant	N
more	N
trees	N
in	N
town	N
.	N
	
The	N
tree	N
I	N
had	N
was	N
some	N
kind	N
of	N
evergreen	N
tree	N
and	N
I	N
planned	N
to	N
plant	N
it	N
in	N
the	N
front	N
yard	N
.	N
	
I	N
asked	N
my	N
Dad	N
where	N
it	N
'd	N
be	N
best	N
to	N
plant	N
it	N
and	N
we	N
picked	N
a	N
spot	N
where	N
there	N
were	N
some	N
flowers	N
,	N
but	N
no	N
trees	N
.	N
	
In	N
order	N
to	N
plant	N
it	N
I	N
read	N
the	N
instructions	N
that	N
came	N
with	N
the	N
tree	N
and	N
started	N
by	N
digging	N
a	N
hole	N
that	N
was	N
about	N
twice	N
the	N
size	N
of	N
the	N
root	C
ball	N
of	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
small	N
tree	N
so	N
this	N
was	N
not	N
a	N
big	N
hole	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
tried	N
to	N
make	N
the	N
hole	N
a	N
good	N
shape	N
before	N
putting	N
in	N
some	N
moss	N
and	N
fill	N
dirt	N
.	N
	
I	N
watered	N
the	N
tree	N
that	N
day	N
and	N
made	N
sure	N
to	N
water	N
it	N
each	N
day	N
for	N
about	N
a	N
week	N
until	N
we	N
had	N
a	N
good	N
rain	N
.	N
	
The	N
tree	N
grew	N
and	N
became	N
quite	N
large	N
.	N
	
The	N
one	N
thing	N
I	N
did	N
n't	N
realize	N
is	N
that	N
I	N
should	N
have	N
planned	N
better	N
for	N
how	N
big	N
the	N
tree	N
was	N
going	N
to	N
get	N
because	N
it	N
ended	N
up	N
shadowing	N
over	N
the	N
flower	N
planters	N
a	N
bit	N
.	N
	
I	N
am	N
an	N
avid	N
gardener	C
.	N
	
I	N
have	N
a	N
large	N
garden	N
and	N
lots	N
of	N
flower	N
beds	N
.	N
	
But	N
this	N
year	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
plant	N
some	N
small	N
fruit	N
trees	N
in	N
my	N
garden	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
nursery	C
and	N
picked	N
out	N
a	N
small	N
dwarf	N
apple	N
tree	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
plant	N
.	N
	
The	N
tree	N
was	N
young	N
and	N
was	N
basically	C
a	N
very	N
small	N
trunk	C
with	N
two	N
branches	N
.	N
	
I	N
brought	N
it	N
home	N
and	N
read	N
the	N
instructions	N
for	N
planting	N
it	N
.	N
	
The	N
whole	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
dig	N
was	N
18	N
inches	N
across	N
and	N
1	N
foot	N
deep	N
.	N
	
I	N
used	N
my	N
garden	N
shovel	N
to	N
break	N
up	N
the	N
grass	N
and	N
dig	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
I	N
saved	N
the	N
dirt	N
in	N
my	N
wheelbarrow	N
to	N
put	N
back	N
in	N
the	N
whole	N
when	N
I	N
was	N
done	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
the	N
small	N
tree	N
in	N
the	N
whole	N
and	N
filled	N
the	N
hole	N
with	N
water	N
.	N
	
When	N
the	N
water	N
had	N
saturated	N
the	N
earth	N
I	N
then	N
shoveled	N
thew	N
leftover	N
dirt	N
back	N
in	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
finished	N
in	N
about	N
15	N
mintes	N
.	N
	
I	N
think	N
I	N
will	N
get	N
several	N
more	N
fruit	N
trees	N
to	N
plant	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
very	N
easy	N
to	N
do	N
.	N
	
I	N
planted	N
a	N
tree	N
for	N
Arbor	N
Day	N
last	N
year	N
.	N
	
The	N
first	N
thing	N
I	N
did	N
was	N
decide	N
where	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
plant	N
my	N
tree	N
and	N
I	N
chose	N
a	N
nice	N
spot	N
in	N
my	N
backyard	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
decided	N
what	N
kind	N
of	N
tree	N
I	N
wanted	N
.	N
	
I	N
thought	N
a	N
shady	N
tree	N
would	N
be	N
nice	N
in	N
that	N
spot	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
a	N
tree	N
place	N
called	N
a	N
nursery	C
and	N
picked	N
out	N
a	N
nice	N
young	N
tree	N
called	N
a	N
sapling	N
and	N
I	N
loaded	N
into	N
the	N
back	N
of	N
my	N
truck	N
to	N
take	N
home	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
was	N
at	N
home	N
again	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
my	N
shovel	N
and	N
dug	N
a	N
hole	N
in	N
the	N
right	N
spot	N
in	N
the	N
backyard	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
unwrapped	N
the	N
trees	N
roots	C
and	N
very	N
,	N
very	N
carefully	N
place	N
the	N
tree	N
into	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
The	N
roots	C
at	N
the	N
bottom	N
are	N
called	N
a	N
root	C
ball	N
and	N
is	N
made	N
of	N
the	N
roots	C
and	N
dirt	N
that	N
protects	N
the	N
roots	C
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
very	N
careful	N
not	N
to	N
knock	N
the	N
dirt	N
off	N
so	N
the	N
roots	C
would	N
n't	N
be	N
damaged	N
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
root	C
ball	N
was	N
settled	N
into	N
the	N
hole	N
and	N
the	N
tree	N
was	N
standing	N
up	N
straight	N
,	N
I	N
filled	N
the	N
hole	N
up	N
with	N
dirt	N
again	N
and	N
then	N
watered	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
My	N
tree	N
is	N
healthy	N
and	N
growing	C
because	N
I	N
was	N
careful	N
with	N
it	N
.	N
	
Every	N
year	N
we	N
celebrate	N
Arbor	N
Day	N
.	N
	
Last	N
year	N
we	N
we	N
decided	N
to	N
celebrate	N
the	N
holiday	N
by	N
planing	N
a	N
tree	N
.	N
	
We	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
local	N
plant	N
nursery	C
.	N
	
We	N
talked	N
to	N
the	N
employees	N
to	N
find	N
out	N
which	N
trees	N
grow	N
well	N
in	N
our	N
area	N
and	N
in	N
the	N
type	N
of	N
soil	C
we	N
have	N
.	N
	
We	N
chose	N
a	N
small	N
maple	N
seedling	N
.	N
	
When	N
we	N
got	N
home	N
,	N
we	N
chose	N
an	N
area	N
of	N
our	N
yard	N
with	N
lots	N
of	N
sun	N
.	N
	
We	N
dug	N
a	N
hole	N
just	N
a	N
little	N
bigger	N
than	N
the	N
roots	C
of	N
our	N
seedling	N
.	N
	
We	N
put	N
the	N
seedling	N
in	N
the	N
hole	N
in	N
the	N
ground	N
very	N
carefully	N
,	N
then	N
covered	N
the	N
roots	C
with	N
dirt	N
.	N
	
We	N
patted	N
the	N
dirt	N
down	N
really	N
good	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
the	N
little	N
tree	N
seedling	N
would	N
be	N
stable	C
in	N
the	N
ground	N
when	N
it	N
was	N
windy	N
.	N
	
Then	N
we	N
watered	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
We	N
've	N
been	N
watching	N
and	N
watering	N
our	N
tree	N
for	N
a	N
year	N
and	N
slowly	N
but	N
surely	C
our	N
little	N
tree	N
is	N
growing	C
.	N
	
If	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
plant	N
a	N
tree	N
it	N
is	N
best	N
to	N
get	N
a	N
small	N
sapling	N
.	N
	
Dig	N
yourself	N
a	N
hole	N
and	N
put	N
the	N
saplings	N
root	C
ball	N
in	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
You	N
do	N
not	N
want	N
to	N
cut	N
or	N
break	N
the	N
roots	C
when	N
you	N
put	N
it	N
in	N
the	N
ground	N
.	N
	
Make	N
sure	N
your	N
hole	N
is	N
big	N
enough	N
but	N
not	N
too	N
deep	N
.	N
	
You	N
also	N
do	N
not	N
want	N
your	N
hole	N
to	N
be	N
too	N
narrow	N
.	N
	
You	N
can	N
remove	N
any	N
dead	N
or	N
dried	N
up	N
roots	C
from	N
the	N
ball	N
.	N
	
You	N
now	N
want	N
to	N
refill	N
with	N
dirt	N
lightly	N
tamping	N
the	N
dirt	N
as	N
you	N
go	N
.	N
	
Make	N
a	N
mound	N
of	N
dirt	N
around	N
the	N
base	C
of	N
the	N
tree	N
with	N
the	N
dirt	N
that	N
no	N
longer	N
fits	N
in	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
Water	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
It	N
is	N
a	N
good	N
idea	N
to	N
also	N
add	N
some	N
sort	N
of	N
mulch	N
to	N
protect	N
the	N
dirt	N
from	N
washing	N
away	N
.	N
	
This	N
will	N
also	N
help	N
keep	N
weeds	N
from	N
growing	C
and	N
help	N
in	N
keeping	N
moisture	N
to	N
roots	C
.	N
	
Fertilize	N
and	N
water	N
your	N
newly	C
planted	N
tree	N
.	N
	
My	N
yard	N
was	N
very	N
bare	C
and	N
plain-looking	N
so	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
add	N
some	N
trees	N
to	N
the	N
landscape	N
.	N
	
First	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
local	N
nursery	C
and	N
asked	N
them	N
for	N
advice	N
on	N
what	N
kinds	N
of	N
trees	N
would	N
do	N
well	N
in	N
my	N
area	N
,	N
level	N
of	N
sunlight	C
,	N
amount	N
of	N
precipitation	N
,	N
etc	N
.	N
	
They	N
gave	N
me	N
some	N
ideas	N
and	N
I	N
picked	N
out	N
a	N
Bradford	N
pear	N
tree	N
sapling	N
.	N
	
I	N
took	N
it	N
home	N
and	N
left	N
it	N
in	N
shade	N
while	N
I	N
prepared	N
to	N
plant	N
it	N
.	N
	
First	N
I	N
got	N
out	N
a	N
shovel	N
and	N
dug	N
a	N
deep	N
enough	N
hole	N
to	N
cover	N
the	N
whole	N
root	C
ball	N
of	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
placed	N
some	N
fertilizer	N
in	N
the	N
bottom	N
of	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
Next	N
I	N
unwrapped	N
the	N
root	C
ball	N
from	N
the	N
burlap	N
sack	C
which	N
contained	N
it	N
and	N
placed	N
it	N
in	N
the	N
hole	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
dug	N
.	N
	
Once	N
it	N
was	N
in	N
,	N
I	N
shoveled	N
the	N
dirt	N
back	N
into	N
the	N
opening	C
and	N
tamped	N
it	N
firmly	C
around	N
the	N
base	C
of	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
I	N
placed	N
a	N
soaker	N
hose	N
near	N
it	N
to	N
give	N
it	N
plenty	N
of	N
water	N
.	N
	
Before	N
you	N
plant	N
a	N
tree	N
,	N
you	N
must	N
contact	N
the	N
utility	N
company	N
.	N
	
They	N
will	N
come	N
to	N
your	N
property	N
and	N
mark	N
out	N
utility	N
lines	N
.	N
	
Without	N
doing	N
this	N
,	N
you	N
may	N
dig	N
down	N
and	N
hit	N
a	N
line	N
,	N
which	N
can	N
be	N
lethal	C
!	N
Once	N
you	N
know	N
where	N
to	N
dig	N
,	N
select	N
what	N
type	N
of	N
tree	N
you	N
want	N
.	N
	
Take	N
things	N
into	N
consideration	C
such	C
as	N
how	N
much	N
sun	N
it	N
gets	N
,	N
what	N
zone	N
you	N
are	N
in	N
,	N
and	N
how	N
quickly	N
you	N
want	N
it	N
to	N
grow	N
.	N
	
Dig	N
a	N
hole	N
large	N
enough	N
for	N
the	N
tree	N
and	N
roots	C
.	N
	
Place	N
the	N
tree	N
in	N
the	N
hole	N
and	N
then	N
fill	N
the	N
hole	N
back	N
up	N
with	N
dirt	N
.	N
	
Many	N
small	N
trees	N
will	N
need	N
support	N
until	N
they	N
are	N
bigger	N
.	N
	
This	N
will	N
ensure	C
they	N
grow	N
tall	N
and	N
straight	N
.	N
	
It	N
is	N
crucial	C
to	N
keep	N
the	N
tree	N
watered	N
!	N
It	N
will	N
need	N
a	N
lot	N
of	N
water	N
at	N
first	N
.	N
	
Mulch	N
is	N
helpful	N
to	N
keep	N
the	N
soil	C
moist	N
.	N
	
It	N
's	N
also	N
important	N
to	N
wait	N
until	N
the	N
threat	C
of	N
a	N
frost	C
has	N
passed	N
or	N
is	N
not	N
in	N
the	N
near	N
future	N
.	N
	
Giving	N
care	N
to	N
your	N
new	N
tree	N
will	N
ensure	C
that	N
it	N
will	N
grow	N
big	N
and	N
strong	N
!	N
Two	N
days	C
ago	N
,	N
it	N
was	N
Earth	N
Day	N
.	N
	
A	N
few	N
people	N
were	N
giving	N
out	N
seeds	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
project	N
the	N
idea	N
of	N
green	N
living	C
into	N
people	N
's	N
minds	N
.	N
	
My	N
friend	N
and	N
I	N
,	N
Joey	N
,	N
decided	N
that	N
we	N
would	N
help	N
to	N
plant	N
a	N
few	N
trees	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
contribute	C
to	N
the	N
efforts	N
.	N
	
We	N
received	N
a	N
few	N
tree	N
saplings	N
in	N
the	N
mail	N
from	N
a	N
catalog	N
.	N
	
Joey	N
and	N
I	N
decided	N
that	N
we	N
would	N
plant	N
them	N
in	N
our	N
backyard	N
to	N
provide	N
shade	N
.	N
	
While	N
the	N
trees	N
might	N
be	N
small	N
now	N
,	N
hopefully	N
they	N
would	N
grow	N
into	N
big	N
trees	N
for	N
maybe	N
our	N
kids	N
.	N
	
We	N
got	N
all	N
down	N
and	N
dirty	N
in	N
the	N
grass	N
,	N
starting	N
to	N
rake	N
up	N
a	N
circle	N
of	N
grass	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
turn	N
over	N
some	N
topsoil	N
.	N
	
We	N
had	N
a	N
trowel	N
,	N
and	N
yes	N
we	N
called	N
it	N
a	N
trowel	N
,	N
and	N
we	N
dug	N
into	N
the	N
dirt	N
to	N
start	N
planting	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
We	N
made	N
a	N
six	N
inch	N
deep	N
hole	N
in	N
the	N
soil	C
,	N
and	N
then	N
put	N
the	N
tree	N
in	N
.	N
	
We	N
finished	N
by	N
packing	N
the	N
soil	C
down	N
around	N
the	N
roots	C
of	N
the	N
small	N
tree	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
we	N
watered	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
bought	N
a	N
little	N
flowering	N
tree	N
at	N
a	N
local	N
greenhouse	N
.	N
	
It	N
came	N
with	N
its	N
roots	C
bundled	N
up	N
in	N
burlap	N
,	N
or	N
something	N
that	N
looks	N
like	N
burlap	N
.	N
	
I	N
dug	N
a	N
hole	N
about	N
two	N
feet	N
deep	N
in	N
my	N
front	N
yard	N
,	N
where	N
I	N
wanted	N
the	N
tree	N
to	N
grow	N
.	N
	
The	N
instructions	N
said	N
to	N
leave	N
the	N
roots	C
in	N
the	N
bag	N
.	N
	
The	N
bag	N
would	N
naturally	C
rot	C
away	N
with	N
time	N
and	N
the	N
roots	C
would	N
poke	N
out	N
of	N
it	N
as	N
they	N
grew	N
.	N
	
Once	N
my	N
hole	N
was	N
dug	N
,	N
I	N
moved	N
the	N
tree	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
spot	N
and	N
put	N
it	N
in	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
started	N
filling	N
up	N
the	N
hole	N
I	N
'd	N
made	N
with	N
the	N
dirt	N
that	N
I	N
'd	N
dug	N
up	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
the	N
tree	N
was	N
standing	N
straight	N
and	N
I	N
tamped	N
down	N
the	N
loose	N
dirt	N
by	N
walking	N
on	N
it	N
until	N
the	N
tree	N
seemed	N
to	N
be	N
firmly	C
in	N
place	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
put	N
some	N
mulch	N
around	N
the	N
base	C
of	N
the	N
tree	N
in	N
a	N
circle	N
.	N
	
That	N
's	N
supposed	N
to	N
help	N
the	N
area	N
retain	C
moisture	N
,	N
which	N
the	N
tree	N
needs	C
to	N
survive	C
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
hose	N
and	N
watered	N
the	N
tree	N
a	N
little	N
to	N
give	N
it	N
a	N
good	N
start	N
in	N
life	N
.	N
	
It	N
's	N
spring	N
time	N
so	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
plant	N
a	N
tree	N
.	N
	
I	N
purchased	N
a	N
small	N
orange	N
tree	N
to	N
go	N
in	N
the	N
back	N
yard	N
.	N
	
First	N
I	N
dug	N
a	N
hole	N
where	N
I	N
wanted	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
shook	N
the	N
roots	C
of	N
the	N
tree	N
to	N
loosen	C
them	N
.	N
	
Then	N
I	N
placed	N
the	N
tree	N
in	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
I	N
used	N
a	N
shovel	N
to	N
replace	N
the	N
dirt	N
back	N
over	N
the	N
tree	N
roots	C
.	N
	
Once	N
satisfied	N
the	N
tree	N
was	N
firmly	C
in	N
the	N
ground	N
i	N
dragged	N
over	N
the	N
hose	N
.	N
	
New	N
trees	N
needs	C
lots	N
of	N
water	N
.	N
	
I	N
watered	N
the	N
tree	N
until	N
I	N
was	N
satisfied	N
and	N
then	N
put	N
mulch	N
around	N
the	N
base	C
.	N
	
I	N
also	N
attached	N
ropes	N
to	N
secure	C
the	N
young	N
tree	N
so	N
it	N
would	N
n't	N
fall	N
over	N
while	N
it	N
's	N
roots	C
were	N
still	N
settling	N
in	N
.	N
	
I	N
also	N
had	N
a	N
canval	N
funnel	N
installed	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
water	N
went	N
right	N
into	N
the	N
roots	C
where	N
it	N
was	N
need	N
most	N
.	N
	
Once	N
all	N
was	N
said	N
and	N
done	N
i	N
stepped	N
back	N
to	N
admire	N
my	N
handy	C
work	N
.	N
	
I	N
did	N
my	N
research	N
and	N
made	N
sure	N
that	N
whatever	N
tree	N
I	N
was	N
planting	N
could	N
survive	C
in	N
my	N
region	N
,	N
since	N
my	N
state	C
can	N
get	N
cold	N
.	N
	
I	N
checked	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
it	N
was	N
okay	N
to	N
plant	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
Since	N
my	N
parents	N
were	N
the	N
land-owners	N
,	N
they	N
said	N
yes	N
.	N
	
I	N
made	N
sure	N
to	N
plant	N
it	N
far	N
away	N
from	N
the	N
house	N
and	N
any	N
piper	N
or	N
wires	N
.	N
	
That	N
way	N
,	N
when	N
it	N
grew	N
larger	N
,	N
it	N
would	N
not	N
be	N
dangerous	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
plant	N
a	N
pine	C
tree	N
.	N
	
They	N
are	N
not	N
as	N
messy	N
in	N
the	N
fall	N
,	N
because	N
they	N
have	N
needles	N
that	N
they	N
keep	N
instead	N
of	N
leaves	N
that	N
they	N
shed	C
.	N
	
I	N
bought	N
a	N
small	N
sapling	N
at	N
a	N
store	N
.	N
	
Growing	C
a	N
tree	N
from	N
a	N
seed	C
is	N
more	N
difficult	N
.	N
	
I	N
dug	N
a	N
hole	N
in	N
the	N
ground	N
wide	N
enough	N
to	N
hold	N
the	N
roots	C
well	N
and	N
about	N
4	N
inches	N
deep	N
.	N
	
I	N
gently	C
removed	N
the	N
tree	N
from	N
its	N
container	C
and	N
placed	N
it	N
into	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
Then	N
,	N
I	N
covered	N
the	N
hole	N
back	N
up	N
with	N
soil	C
and	N
watered	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
Earth	N
day	N
happens	N
every	N
year	N
on	N
April	N
22	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
to	N
do	N
something	N
about	N
it	N
later	N
year	N
and	N
went	N
out	N
to	N
plant	N
a	N
tree	N
this	N
year	N
.	N
	
I	N
wondered	N
over	N
to	N
a	N
local	N
tree	N
farm	N
,	N
and	N
bought	N
a	N
sapling	N
with	N
a	N
friend	N
.	N
	
We	N
both	N
borrowed	N
a	N
friend	N
's	N
pick	N
up	N
truck	N
and	N
drove	N
to	N
a	N
place	N
in	N
the	N
woods	N
that	N
we	N
usually	N
hang	N
out	N
at	N
.	N
	
While	N
we	N
arrived	N
there	N
,	N
it	N
was	N
beautiful	N
weather	N
for	N
the	N
beginning	N
of	N
Spring	N
.	N
	
We	N
went	N
off	N
to	N
the	N
area	N
where	N
we	N
always	N
set	N
up	N
our	N
tents	N
when	N
we	N
go	N
camping	N
.	N
	
We	N
ended	N
up	N
digging	N
near	N
the	N
campsite	N
and	N
removed	N
the	N
bag	N
around	N
the	N
sapling	N
.	N
	
Carefully	N
,	N
we	N
both	N
picked	N
up	N
the	N
tree	N
and	N
placed	N
it	N
in	N
the	N
hole	N
we	N
dug	N
and	N
it	N
fit	N
in	N
perfectly	N
!	N
After	N
that	N
I	N
carefully	N
held	N
the	N
tree	N
in	N
place	N
while	N
my	N
friend	N
filled	N
the	N
hole	N
back	N
with	N
dirt	N
.	N
	
A	N
year	N
later	N
,	N
the	N
tree	N
is	N
still	N
growing	C
in	N
perfect	N
health	N
.	N
	
I	N
decided	N
one	N
day	N
to	N
plant	N
a	N
tree	N
in	N
my	N
front	N
yard	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
unsure	C
of	N
what	N
sort	N
of	N
tree	N
I	N
should	N
plant	N
so	N
I	N
went	N
online	N
and	N
did	N
research	N
as	N
to	N
which	N
type	N
of	N
tree	N
would	N
be	N
best	N
for	N
my	N
situation	N
.	N
	
I	N
settled	N
on	N
a	N
magnificent	N
Norway	N
Pine	C
,	N
as	N
it	N
is	N
common	N
in	N
Northern	N
Minnesota	N
.	N
	
I	N
went	N
out	N
to	N
my	N
nearest	N
greenhouse	N
,	N
which	N
I	N
found	C
via	N
Google	N
Maps	N
,	N
and	N
asked	N
them	N
where	N
they	N
kept	N
their	N
saplings	N
-LRB-	N
as	N
I	N
had	N
read	N
that	N
this	N
is	N
how	N
one	N
should	N
plant	N
a	N
tree	N
-RRB-	N
.	N
	
I	N
got	N
the	N
sapling	N
and	N
brought	N
it	N
home	N
with	N
me	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
only	N
six	N
inches	N
high	N
but	N
I	N
knew	N
I	N
could	N
make	N
it	N
grow	N
tall	N
and	N
strong	N
.	N
	
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
shovel	N
and	N
started	N
to	N
dig	N
,	N
one	N
small	N
hole	N
the	N
size	N
of	N
the	N
pot	N
the	N
sapling	N
was	N
in	N
.	N
	
I	N
carefully	N
took	N
the	N
sapling	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
pot	N
and	N
placed	N
it	N
into	N
the	N
freshly	N
dug	N
hole	N
.	N
	
Filling	N
in	N
the	N
empty	N
parts	N
of	N
the	N
hole	N
with	N
extra	N
dirt	N
,	N
I	N
marveled	N
at	N
my	N
creation	C
.	N
	
That	N
was	N
the	N
day	N
I	N
planted	N
a	N
tree	N
in	N
my	N
front	N
yard	N
.	N
	
Yesterday	N
I	N
planted	N
a	N
tree	N
.	N
	
First	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
a	N
nursery	C
.	N
	
A	N
nursery	C
is	N
a	N
place	N
where	N
they	N
have	N
,	N
flowers	N
,	N
plants	N
,	N
shrubs	N
and	N
trees	N
.	N
	
I	N
chose	N
a	N
sapling	N
-	N
a	N
young	N
tree	N
-	N
paid	N
for	N
it	N
and	N
put	N
in	N
in	N
the	N
back	N
of	N
my	N
pickup	N
truck	N
.	N
	
When	N
I	N
got	N
home	N
I	N
got	N
a	N
shovel	N
out	N
of	N
my	N
shed	C
and	N
dug	N
a	N
hole	N
where	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
tree	N
to	N
grow	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
it	N
was	N
n't	N
too	N
near	N
my	N
house	N
.	N
	
I	N
dug	N
the	N
hole	N
about	N
two	N
feet	N
deep	N
,	N
a	N
little	N
bigger	N
than	N
the	N
root	C
ball	N
on	N
the	N
bottom	N
of	N
my	N
tree	N
.	N
	
Once	N
I	N
had	N
the	N
hole	N
dug	N
,	N
I	N
dropped	N
the	N
tree	N
in	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
the	N
trunk	C
was	N
straight	N
.	N
	
I	N
cut	N
the	N
burlap	N
surrounding	C
the	N
root	C
ball	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
filled	N
in	N
the	N
space	N
around	N
the	N
tree	N
with	N
the	N
dirt	N
I	N
had	N
dug	N
out	N
earlier	N
.	N
	
Finally	N
,	N
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
garden	N
hose	N
and	N
watered	N
the	N
tree	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
to	N
give	N
it	N
a	N
good	N
soaking	C
.	N
	
The	N
tree	N
should	N
give	N
us	N
pleasure	N
for	N
years	N
to	N
come	N
.	N
	
My	N
husband	N
and	N
I	N
love	N
trees	N
.	N
	
In	N
the	N
spring	N
we	N
bought	N
some	N
trees	N
from	N
a	N
catalog	N
and	N
planted	N
them	N
in	N
May	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
a	N
nice	N
warm	N
day	N
and	N
the	N
sun	N
was	N
shining	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
n't	N
too	N
hot	N
because	N
there	N
was	N
a	N
cool	N
breeze	N
.	N
	
We	N
went	N
out	N
to	N
the	N
back	N
garden	N
with	N
shovels	N
and	N
trowels	N
,	N
gardening	C
gloves	N
and	N
the	N
hose	N
.	N
	
We	N
each	N
dug	N
a	N
hole	N
.	N
	
Mine	N
was	N
for	N
the	N
white	N
birch	N
I	N
had	N
picked	N
out	N
,	N
and	N
my	N
husband	N
's	N
was	N
for	N
a	N
hazel	N
tree	N
he	N
had	N
picked	N
out	N
.	N
	
We	N
laughed	N
and	N
talked	N
as	N
we	N
worked	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
digging	N
went	N
quickly	N
.	N
	
The	N
soil	C
was	N
also	N
not	N
too	N
stony	N
,	N
which	N
helped	N
us	N
greatly	C
.	N
	
Soon	N
we	N
had	N
our	N
trees	N
in	N
the	N
holes	N
,	N
and	N
held	N
them	N
upright	C
as	N
we	N
scooped	N
the	N
dirt	N
back	N
into	N
the	N
holes	N
with	N
our	N
trowels	N
.	N
	
We	N
patted	N
the	N
dirt	N
down	N
,	N
made	N
sure	N
the	N
trees	N
were	N
upright	C
,	N
and	N
gave	N
them	N
some	N
water	N
to	N
grow	N
on	N
.	N
	
Soon	N
we	N
would	N
have	N
two	N
beautiful	N
trees	N
.	N
	
Earth	N
day	N
is	N
a	N
very	N
important	N
day	N
in	N
America	N
.	N
	
It	N
is	N
a	N
day	N
where	N
we	N
recognize	N
the	N
environment	C
and	N
the	N
fact	N
that	N
we	N
need	N
to	N
protect	N
it	N
.	N
	
This	N
earth	N
day	N
my	N
friend	N
Patrick	N
and	N
I	N
decided	N
that	N
we	N
should	N
plant	N
a	N
tree	N
to	N
counteract	N
the	N
effects	N
of	N
deforesting	N
.	N
	
To	N
do	N
this	N
we	N
first	N
dug	N
a	N
hole	N
in	N
the	N
ground	N
twice	N
the	N
size	N
of	N
the	N
root	C
ball	N
of	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
It	N
was	N
hard	N
work	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
ensures	N
that	N
the	N
tree	N
has	N
enough	N
loose	N
soil	C
to	N
spread	C
its	N
roots	C
in	N
.	N
	
We	N
then	N
placed	N
the	N
tree	N
in	N
the	N
middle	C
of	N
the	N
pit	C
we	N
had	N
dug	N
and	N
made	N
sure	N
it	N
was	N
centered	N
.	N
	
After	N
that	N
we	N
filled	N
in	N
the	N
rest	N
of	N
the	N
pit	C
with	N
a	N
high	N
quality	N
planting	N
soil	C
in	N
order	N
to	N
give	N
the	N
tree	N
proper	N
nutrition	C
.	N
	
After	N
the	N
soil	C
was	N
placed	N
in	N
we	N
stepped	N
on	N
the	N
soil	C
to	N
compact	N
it	N
and	N
make	N
sure	N
the	N
tree	N
stays	N
in	N
place	N
.	N
	
It	N
felt	N
really	N
good	N
to	N
give	N
back	N
to	N
the	N
environment	C
instead	N
of	N
damaging	N
it	N
.	N
	
In	N
the	N
morning	N
,	N
I	N
woke	N
up	N
to	N
prepare	N
for	N
the	N
day	N
.	N
	
After	N
getting	N
coffee	N
ready	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
on	N
breakfast	N
.	N
	
My	N
partner	N
awoke	N
,	N
and	N
she	N
began	N
to	N
get	N
ready	N
in	N
the	N
bathroom	N
.	N
	
She	N
was	N
out	N
by	N
the	N
time	N
food	N
was	N
ready	N
.	N
	
We	N
spoke	N
about	N
our	N
plans	N
for	N
the	N
day	N
,	N
and	N
what	N
we	N
intended	N
our	N
goals	N
to	N
be	N
.	N
	
After	N
getting	N
dressed	N
up	N
to	N
head	N
outside	N
,	N
we	N
headed	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
gardening	C
store	N
to	N
choose	N
a	N
tree	N
for	N
our	N
yard	N
.	N
	
Both	N
of	N
us	N
were	N
hoping	N
for	N
a	N
nice	N
Japanese	N
Maple	N
tree	N
.	N
	
The	N
checkout	N
lady	N
was	N
nice	N
,	N
we	N
found	C
exactly	N
what	N
we	N
were	N
looking	N
for	N
after	N
we	N
got	N
into	N
the	N
store	N
.	N
	
Driving	N
home	N
,	N
we	N
could	N
barely	C
contain	N
our	N
excitement	N
.	N
	
After	N
stepping	N
back	N
in	N
the	N
house	N
for	N
a	N
quick	N
snack	N
and	N
another	N
cup	N
of	N
coffee	N
,	N
we	N
set	N
out	N
to	N
the	N
shed	C
to	N
get	N
the	N
right	N
tools	N
.	N
	
The	N
hole	N
was	N
easy	N
to	N
dig	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
tree	N
was	N
transplanted	N
successfully	C
.	N
	
I	N
travel	N
to	N
the	N
local	N
nursery	C
to	N
select	N
a	N
tree	N
for	N
planting	N
,	N
today	N
I	N
have	N
decided	N
to	N
purchase	C
a	N
flowering	N
maple	N
tree	N
.	N
	
I	N
ensure	C
the	N
one	N
I	N
pick	N
is	N
high	N
quality	N
with	N
no	N
rotting	N
and	N
looks	N
healthy	N
.	N
	
Once	N
in	N
my	N
yard	N
I	N
determine	C
the	N
best	N
location	N
based	N
on	N
the	N
expected	C
height	N
it	N
will	N
grow	N
and	N
other	N
plants	N
in	N
the	N
yard	N
.	N
	
With	N
my	N
garden	N
shovel	N
I	N
dig	N
a	N
hole	N
at	N
least	N
twice	N
the	N
size	N
of	N
the	N
roots	C
of	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
I	N
ensure	C
rocks	N
and	N
are	N
removed	N
from	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N
	
I	N
put	N
plenty	N
of	N
organic	C
matter	N
in	N
the	N
hole	N
to	N
ensure	C
good	N
growth	C
.	N
	
I	N
gently	C
place	N
the	N
tree	N
in	N
the	N
hole	N
and	N
refill	N
with	N
the	N
shoveled	N
dirt	N
.	N
	
I	N
place	N
my	N
garden	N
hose	N
at	N
the	N
base	C
of	N
the	N
tree	N
and	N
turn	N
the	N
water	N
to	N
a	N
very	N
slow	N
stream	N
so	N
it	N
will	N
absorb	C
into	N
the	N
soil	C
properly	N
.	N
	
I	N
allow	N
the	N
water	N
to	N
run	N
for	N
about	N
and	N
hour	N
ensuring	N
it	N
does	N
n't	N
get	N
soggy	N
.	N
	
I	N
step	N
back	N
and	N
admire	N
my	N
new	N
tree	N
and	N
envision	C
what	N
it	N
will	N
look	N
like	N
a	N
year	N
from	N
now	N
.	N
	
A	N
few	N
years	N
ago	N
,	N
I	N
did	N
some	N
volunteer	C
work	N
in	N
my	N
local	N
community	C
.	N
	
I	N
like	N
giving	N
back	N
to	N
my	N
community	C
.	N
	
One	N
of	N
the	N
things	N
we	N
did	N
was	N
plant	N
trees	N
in	N
the	N
city	N
.	N
	
This	N
was	N
my	N
first	N
experience	N
with	N
planting	N
trees	N
.	N
	
First	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
prepare	N
the	N
ground	N
.	N
	
The	N
soil	C
was	N
already	N
in	N
great	N
shape	N
for	N
the	N
tree	N
so	N
that	N
part	N
was	N
taken	N
care	N
of	N
.	N
	
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
shovel	N
and	N
then	N
started	N
digging	N
.	N
	
Then	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
to	N
plan	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
The	N
tree	N
was	N
small	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
remove	N
it	N
from	N
the	N
pot	N
by	N
putting	N
it	N
upside	N
down	N
.	N
	
I	N
then	N
gently	C
placed	N
the	N
tree	N
in	N
the	N
hole	N
and	N
then	N
filled	N
the	N
hole	N
back	N
up	N
with	N
the	N
dirt	N
.	N
	
The	N
next	N
thing	N
I	N
did	N
was	N
add	N
mulch	N
around	N
the	N
area	N
of	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
Once	N
the	N
mulch	N
was	N
added	N
,	N
I	N
put	N
a	N
stake	N
in	N
the	N
ground	N
and	N
tied	N
it	N
to	N
the	N
tree	N
.	N
	
This	N
was	N
to	N
hold	N
the	N
tree	N
in	N
place	N
as	N
it	N
grows	N
for	N
the	N
first	N
year	N
.	N
