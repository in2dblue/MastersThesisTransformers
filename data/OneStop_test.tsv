in	N
a	N

In	N
Romevas	N
view	N

the	N

is	N
also	N
at	N
fault	C
because	N
the	N

Many	N

My	N
opinion	N

that	N
of	N

that	N
we	N
agree	N

after	N

strong	N
reason	N
for	N

.The	N
big	N
difference	N
between	N

that	N
we	N

what	N
is	N

for	N

in	N

?	N
When	N
I	N
was	N

lucky	N

In	N
Osteraker	N

I	N

my	N

the	N

We	N
were	N

But	N
I	N
knew	N
that	N
not	N
all	N
Swedish	N

that	N

I	N
met	N

needed	N

I	N

I	N
wanted	N
to	N

With	N
X-Cons	N
,	N
we	N
meet	N
them	N
at	N
the	N
gate	N
and	N
support	N
them	N
into	N
accommodation	N
and	N
offer	N
a	N
network	C
of	N
support.In	N
Sweden	N
,	N
we	N
believe	N
very	N
much	N
in	N
the	N
concept	C
of	N
rehabilitation	N

without	N
being	N
naive	C
of	N
course	N
,	N
says	N
Gustafsson	N

There	N
are	N
some	N
people	N
who	N
will	N
not	N
or	N
can	N
not	N
change	N
.	N
	
But	N
,	N
in	N
my	N
experience	N
,	N
the	N
majority	C
of	N
prisoners	N
want	N
to	N
change	N
,	N
and	N
we	N
must	N
do	N
what	N
we	N
can	N
to	N
help	N
to	N
facilitate	C
that	N
.	N
	
It	N
is	N
not	N
always	N
possible	N
to	N

this	N
in	N

,	N
it	N
is	N
not	N
just	N
prison	N
that	N
can	N
rehabilitate	N
it	N
is	N
often	N
a	N

process	C

probation	N

greater	N
society	N

We	N
can	N

but	N
,	N
when	N
they	N

The	N

down	N

The	N

could	N
perform	N
at	N
their	N
peak	N
with	N
only	N
a	N
couple	N

hours	N

Suppose	C
a	N
human	N
could	N
be	N

the	N

amount	N

time	N
as	N
a	N
giraffe	N
(	N
1.9	N
hours	N
per	N
night	N
)	N

This	N
would	N
lead	N
to	N
an	N
approximately	N
twofold	N
decrease	N
in	N
the	N
casualty	C
rate	C

An	N
adversary	N
would	N
need	N
an	N
approximately	N
40	N

increase	N
in	N
the	N
troop	N
level	N
to	N
compensate	C
for	N
this	N
advantage	N

The	N
report	N
goes	N
on	N

study	N
how	N
these	N
false	N

form	N
in	N
the	N
human	N

They	N
put	N
memories	N
in	N
the	N

of	N
mice	N
by	N
changing	N
individual	N
neurons.In	N
the	N
experiment	N

put	N
the	N

explore	N
it	N

As	N
they	N
explored	N
it	N
,	N
their	N
brain	N

created	N
a	N

The	N
next	N

,	N
they	N
put	N
the	N
same	N
mice	N
in	N
a	N
second	N
box	N
and	N
gave	N
them	N
a	N
small	N
electric	N
shock	N

This	N
scared	N
the	N

At	N
the	N

time	N
,	N
the	N
researchers	N
shone	N
light	N
into	N
the	N

to	N
bring	N
back	N
their	N
memories	N
of	N
the	N
first	N
box	N
.	N
	
That	N
way	N
,	N
the	N
mice	N
associated	N
fear	N
of	N
the	N
electric	N
shock	N
with	N
the	N
memory	N
of	N
the	N
first	N
box.In	N
the	N

The	N

However	N
,	N
they	N
had	N
not	N
received	N
the	N

no	N

when	N

Humans	N
are	N
very	N

So	N
,	N
just	N
like	N
our	N

it	N
is	N
quite	N
possible	N

with	N
bad	N

there	N
could	N

what	N
you	N

rather	N
than	N
what	N

you.He	N
added	N
:	N
Our	N

showed	N
that	N
the	N

It	N
is	N

warned	N
that	N
the	N
false	N

created	N
in	N
the	N

in	N
the	N

were	N

that	N
it	N
will	N
be	N
a	N

a	N
similar	N
project	N
in	N
Liberia	N
,	N
so	N
that	N
HIV	N
sufferers	N
could	N
have	N
work	N
and	N
also	N
get	N
a	N
source	C
of	N
protein.I	N
saw	N
this	N
film	N
about	N
fish	N
in	N
a	N
cement	N
pool	N
and	N
I	N
thought	N
it	N
was	N
a	N
good	N
idea	N
,	N
said	N
Chon	N
,	N
who	N
is	N
also	N
HIV	N
positive	N
.	N
	
So	N
many	N
of	N
the	N
people	N
I	N
work	N
with	N
dont	N
have	N
the	N
money	N
to	N
have	N
a	N
balanced	C
protein	C
diet	N
and	N
fish	N
is	N
such	C
a	N
clean	N
source	C
of	N
protein	C
it	N
doesnt	N
cause	C
health	N
problems	N
like	N
other	N
sources	N
and	N
it	N
is	N
something	N
we	N
can	N
farm.Chon	N
began	N
building	N
a	N
pool	N
in	N
which	N
to	N
farm	N
fish	N
.	N
	
In	N
June	N
2012	N
,	N
she	N
met	N
John	N
Sheehy	N
.	N
	
He	N
raised	N
money	N
for	N
the	N
non-profit	N
fish	N
farm	N
in	N
the	N
northeast	N
of	N
Monrovia	N
,	N
Liberias	N
capital	N
,	N
and	N
started	N
learning	C
about	N
fish	N
farming	N
,	N
doing	N
an	N
online	N
course	N
and	N
speaking	N
to	N
other	N
fish	N
farmers	N
in	N
Africa.I	N
raised	N
the	N
money	N
and	N
built	N
the	N
farm	N
,	N
learned	N
how	N
to	N
build	N
the	N
tanks	N
and	N
water	N
flow	N
system	N
,	N
said	N
Sheehy	N
.	N
	
I	N
learnt	N
a	N
lot	N
on	N
my	N
own	N
and	N
now	N
I	N
would	N
love	N
to	N
be	N
able	C
to	N
write	N
a	N
book	N
and	N
share	N
my	N
knowledge	N
with	N
other	N
people	N
,	N
he	N
said.The	N
project	N
is	N
now	N
a	N
fish	N
farm	N
with	N
12	N
tanks	N
,	N
each	N
with	N
5000	N
fish	N
and	N
will	N
give	N
up	N
to	N
200000	N
fish	N
per	N
year	N
to	N
a	N
community	C
of	N
1200	N
mainly	N
HIV-positive	N
people	N
,	N
including	N
King	N
and	N
his	N
family	N
.	N
	
In	N
addition	C
to	N
the	N
fish	N
,	N
waste	N
from	N
the	N
tanks	N
is	N
collected	N
and	N
used	N
to	N
water	N
crops	N
,	N
also	N
giving	N
food	N
and	N
money	N
to	N
the	N
community.Many	N
people	N
in	N
the	N
community	C
work	N
on	N
the	N
farm	N
,	N
said	N
Sheehy	N
,	N
and	N
what	N
they	N
get	N
in	N
return	N
is	N
fish	N
.	N
	
They	N
can	N
use	N
those	N
fish	N
to	N
feed	N
themselves	N
and	N
to	N
sell	N
in	N
the	N
market	N
so	N
that	N
they	N
get	N
money	N
to	N
buy	N
other	N
food	N

The	N
fish	N
farm	N
gives	N
these	N
people	N
with	N
HIV	N
a	N
way	N
of	N
getting	N
back	N
into	N
society	N
now	N
they	N
are	N
buying	N

selling	N
with	N
people	N
in	N
the	N

every	N
week.1.5	N
%	N
of	N
Liberias	N
3.5	N
million	N

are	N
HIV	N
positive	N

Good	N
nutrition	C
is	N
particularly	N
important	N
for	N
people	N
with	N
HIV	N

They	N
need	N
much	N
more	N
protein	C
to	N
stop	N
their	N
health	N
getting	N
worse	N

to	N
allow	N

Nutrition	C

if	N

The	N

if	N
you	N

they	N
can	N
make	N
you	N
very	N

But	N
food	N
in	N
Liberia	N
is	N
very	N
expensive	N
.	N
	
We	N
buy	N
expensive	N
rice	N
from	N
other	N
countries	N
and	N
fish	N
is	N
difficult	N
for	N
most	N

farming	N
is	N
absolutely	N
possible	N
in	N
Africa	N

Paul	N

which	N
produces	N
3000	N

But	N
some	N
people	N
criticize	C

they	N
say	N
the	N
fish	N
can	N
be	N
inbred	N

A	N

now	N

that	N

The	N

the	N

tests	N
Anderson	N

his	N
colleagues	N
did	N
involved	N
180	N
students	N

employees	N
at	N
Lancaster	N

Half	N
of	N
the	N
people	N
were	N
told	N
to	N
tell	N
the	N

the	N

A	N
company	N
from	N
the	N
Netherlands	N
wants	N
to	N
turn	N
dreams	N
of	N
reaching	N
Mars	N
into	N
reality	C

The	N
company	N
,	N
Mars	N
One	N
,	N
plans	N
to	N
send	N
four	N
astronauts	N
to	N
the	N
Red	N
Planet	N
to	N
build	N
a	N
human	N
colony	N
in	N
2023	N
.	N
	
But	N
there	N
are	N
two	N
serious	N
problems.Firstly	N
,	N
on	N
Mars	N
the	N
astronauts	N
bodies	N
will	N
have	N
to	N
adapt	C
to	N
gravity	N
that	N
is	N
38	N
%	N
of	N
gravity	N
on	N
Earth	N
.	N
	
This	N
would	N
probably	N
cause	C
such	C
a	N
total	N
change	N
in	N
their	N
bones	N
,	N
muscles	N
and	N
circulation	C
that	N
the	N
astronauts	N
would	N
no	N
longer	N
be	N
able	C
to	N
survive	C
on	N
Earth	N
.	N
	
Secondly	C
,	N
they	N
will	N
have	N
to	N
say	N
goodbye	N
to	N
all	N
their	N
family	N
and	N
friends	N
,	N
because	N
there	N
is	N
no	N
return	N
ticket.The	N
Mars	N
One	N
website	N
says	N
that	N
the	N
astronauts	N
can	N
not	N
expect	N
to	N
return	N
.	N
	
To	N
return	N
,	N
they	N
would	N
need	N
a	N
rocket	C
that	N
can	N
leave	N
Mars	N
.	N
	
The	N
rocket	C
would	N
need	N
life	N
support	N
systems	N
for	N
a	N
seven-month	N
journey	N
and	N
would	N
need	N
to	N
either	N
join	N
up	N
with	N
a	N
space	N
station	N
or	N
land	N
safely	N
on	N
Earth.But	N
the	N
project	N
has	N
already	N
had	N
10000	N
applicants	N
,	N
according	N
to	N
the	N
companys	N
Medical	C
Director	N
,	N
Norbert	N
Kraft	N
.	N
	
He	N
told	N
The	N
Guardian	N
that	N
the	N
applicants	N
so	N
far	N
were	N
aged	N
18	N
to	N
at	N
least	N
62	N
and	N
,	N
although	N
they	N
include	N
women	N
,	N
they	N
were	N
mostly	N
men.Mars	N
One	N
says	N
that	N
the	N
astronauts	N
must	N
be	N
resilient	C
,	N
adaptable	N
,	N
curious	N
,	N
trusting	N
and	N
resourceful	C
.	N
	
They	N
must	N
also	N
be	N
over	N
18.Mars	N
One	N
says	N
that	N
the	N
basic	N
things	N
people	N
need	N
to	N
live	N
are	N
already	N
present	N
on	N
the	N
planet	N
.	N
	
For	N
example	N
,	N
they	N
can	N
take	N
water	N
from	N

Mars	N

of	N
nitrogen	N

The	N

project	N
will	N
cost	N

There	N
was	N
a	N

then	N
lots	N

My	N
first	N
thought	N
was	N
that	N
it	N
was	N
a	N
plane	N

In	N
fact	N
,	N
it	N
was	N
a	N
ten-tonne	N
meteorite	N
that	N
fell	N
to	N
Earth	N
in	N
lots	N

pieces.Almost	N
1200	N

More	N

were	N
taken	N
to	N

them	N
were	N
hurt	N
by	N
flying	N

There	N
were	N
no	N
deaths.The	N
meteorite	N
entered	N
the	N
atmosphere	N
at	N
a	N
speed	N
of	N
at	N

33000	N

and	N
broke	N
into	N

between	N
18	N

32	N

then	N
the	N

and	N
we	N
could	N
see	N
smoke	N
in	N
the	N

Then	N
,	N
after	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
,	N
the	N
explosions	N
came.At	N

three	N

were	N
found	C

One	N
crater	N
was	N
more	N
than	N
six	N

Another	N
piece	N
of	N
meteorite	N
broke	N
through	N
the	N
thick	N
ice	N

a	N
lake.In	N
Chelyabinsk	N

were	N
told	N
to	N
go	N
home	N
early	N

About	N
200	N
children	N
were	N
injured.Many	N
people	N
,	N
mostly	N
with	N
cuts	N
from	N
flying	N
glass	N

came	N
into	N
the	N

She	N
said	N
many	N

the	N

There	N
were	N
a	N
lot	N

The	N

the	N

much	N
wider	N
,	N
said	N
Sandberg	N
.	N
	
The	N
main	N
reason	N
humans	N
control	N
the	N

is	N
that	N
we	N
are	N
very	N
good	N
at	N
communicating	N
and	N
coordinating	N

Without	N
that	N
,	N
although	N
we	N
are	N
very	N
clever	N
animals	N
,	N
we	N
would	N
not	N
control	N
the	N

dont	N
think	N
these	N
experiments	N
will	N
create	N
very	N
smart	N
rats	N

he	N
added	N

Theres	N
a	N
big	N
difference	N
between	N
sharing	N
information	N
through	N
the	N
senses	N
and	N
being	N
able	C
to	N
plan	N

Im	N
not	N
worried	N
about	N
clever	N
rats	N
taking	N
control	N
of	N
the	N
world.We	N
know	N
very	N
little	N
about	N
how	N
people	N
process	C
thoughts	N
and	N
how	N
they	N
could	N
be	N
sent	N
to	N
another	N
persons	N

so	N
that	N
will	N
not	N
happen	N
any	N
time	N
soon	N

And	N
much	N
of	N
what	N
is	N
in	N
our	N
minds	N
is	N
what	N
Sandberg	N
calls	N
a	N
draft	C
of	N
what	N
we	N
might	N
do	N

And	N
we	N

anything	N

Most	N
of	N

the	N

not	N
break	N
the	N

There	N
is	N
a	N
law	N

the	N
1960s	N

This	N

that	N
the	N

200	N

800	N

people	N
say	N
more	N
houses	N

Galindo	N

it	N

it	N
from	N

fear	N
that	N

It	N

happen	N

so	N
I	N

it	N

We	N

We	N
can	N
thank	N
public	N
health	N
systems	N

vaccination	C
and	N
antibiotics	N
for	N
this.In	N
intensive	C
care	N

antibiotic	C

bacteria	C
are	N
most	N
common	N

Here	N
,	N
powerful	N
antibiotics	N
are	N
used	N
very	N
often	N
.	N
	
These	N
drugs	N
kill	N
ordinary	N
bacteria	C
.	N
	
But	N
they	N
can	N
not	N
kill	N
strong	N
bacteria	C
that	N
have	N
begun	N
to	N
learn	N
how	N
to	N
survive	C
antibiotic	C
drugs.When	N
I	N
became	N
a	N
doctor	N
in	N
the	N
1990s	N
,	N
I	N
learnt	N
about	N
Methicillin	N
Resistant	N
Staphylococcus	N
Aureus	N
(	N
MRSA	N
)	N
is	N
a	N
bacteria	C
that	N
is	N
resistant	N
to	N
methicillin	N
and	N
all	N
other	N
penicillins	N
.	N
	
There	N
were	N
just	N
a	N
few	N
drugs	N
that	N
could	N
kill	N
it	N
for	N
example	N
,	N
vancomycin	N
and	N
teicoplanin	N
.	N
	
But	N
antibiotic	C
resistant	N
bacteria	C
became	N
more	N
and	N
more	N
common.In	N
our	N
hospitals	N
and	N
our	N
doctors	N
surgeries	N
we	N
use	N
antiobiotics	N
too	N
often.Also	N
,	N
we	N
have	N
put	N
antibiotics	N
into	N
the	N
food	N
chain	N
,	N
when	N
we	N
grow	N
food	N
and	N
when	N
we	N
put	N
anti-bacterial	N
drugs	N
into	N
food	N
for	N
farm	N
animals.We	N
thought	N
that	N
antibiotics	N
were	N
something	N
we	N
could	N
use	N
forever	N
.	N
	
We	N
thought	N
that	N
companies	N
would	N
continue	N
to	N
make	N
more	N
and	N
more	N
antibiotics.But	N
this	N
is	N
no	N
longer	N
true	N
.	N
	
We	N
have	N
found	C
new	N
,	N
more	N
resistant	N
bacteria	C
.	N
	
The	N
vancomycin	N
that	N
we	N
used	N
to	N
treat	C
MRSA	N
infection	C
no	N
longer	N
worked	N
.	N
	
We	N
found	C
Vancomycin	N
Resistant	N
Staphylococcus	N
Aureus	N
(	N
VRSA	N
)	N
in	N
our	N
hospitals	N
.	N
	
And	N
other	N
bacteria	C
were	N
becoming	N
resistant	N
too.Today	N
,	N
infections	N
with	N
organisms	N
that	N
are	N
very	N
resistant	N
are	N
common	N
,	N
but	N
fewer	N
and	N
fewer	N
new	N
antibiotic	C
drugs	N
are	N
made	N
.	N
	
It	N
is	N
more	N
and	N
more	N
difficult	N
to	N
develop	N
new	N
drugs	N
that	N
can	N
kill	N
resistant	N
bacteria	C
.	N
	
Antibiotics	N
have	N
become	N
drugs	N
that	N
are	N
expensive	N
to	N
develop	N
,	N
that	N
are	N
only	N
used	N
in	N
short	N
courses	N
and	N
that	N
quickly	N
stop	N
working	N
because	N
of	N
bacterial	N
resistance.This	N
war	N
against	N
bacteria	C
is	N
different	N
from	N
all	N
other	N
wars	N
.	N
	
There	N
needs	C
to	N
be	N
change	N
in	N
the	N
way	N
doctors	N
give	N
antibiotics	N
and	N
we	N
need	N
to	N
use	N
fewer	N
antibiotics	N
in	N
farming	N
.	N
	
And	N
we	N
have	N
to	N
give	N
companies	N
good	N
reasons	N
why	N
they	N
should	N
make	N
new	N
antibiotics	N
,	N
which	N
will	N
not	N
make	N
them	N
lots	N
of	N
money.Today	N
,	N
antibiotic	C
resistance	C
has	N
become	N
a	N
normal	N
part	N
of	N
life	N

Less	N

a	N
hundred	N

after	N
the	N

it.Its	N
a	N

situation	N
in	N
all	N
of	N

most	N
northern	N

during	N

where	N

In	N

this	N
Ramadan	N
has	N
been	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
most	N
difficult	N

tests	N
bought	N
on	N

in	N

do	N
not	N
work	N

The	N

if	N

so	N
testing	N

can	N
not	N
give	N
any	N

often	N

are	N
on	N
very	N
limited	N

their	N
parents	N

But	N
you	N
need	N
to	N

this	N
takes	N
a	N

may	N

these	N

in	N
regions	N
of	N
Europe	N
where	N
lots	N
of	N
people	N
live	N
and	N
this	N
shows	N
that	N
they	N
could	N
live	N
even	N
in	N
the	N
British	N
countryside.Guillaume	N

from	N

Chapron	N

He	N
also	N
said	N
that	N
the	N
big	N
carnivore	N
revival	C
shows	N
the	N
success	N
of	N
a	N
land-sharing	N
method	N
of	N
conservation	C
it	N
is	N
different	N
from	N
the	N
method	N
in	N
North	N
America	N

Africa	N
,	N
where	N
they	N
use	N
fences	N
to	N
separate	N
these	N

in	N
wilderness	C
areas.Im	N
not	N
saying	C
its	N
a	N
perfect	N
love	N
story	N
living	C
together	N
often	N

conflict	C

its	N

that	N
conflict	C

resolve	C
the	N
problems	N
it	N
causes	N

Wolves	N
can	N
be	N
difficult	N
neighbours	N

said	N
Chapron.According	N
to	N
the	N
researchers	N
,	N
countries	N
in	N
other	N
parts	N
of	N
the	N
world	N
could	N
use	N
this	N
land-sharing	N
method	N
.	N
	
Land-sharing	N
works	N
in	N
Europe	N
because	N
there	N
are	N
more	N
and	N
more	N
animals	N
such	C
as	N
wild	N
deer	C
for	N
the	N
predators	N
to	N
eat	N
and	N
there	N
is	N
money	N
for	N
electric	N
fences	N
to	N
protect	N
livestock	N
fences	N

so	N
farmers	N
do	N
not	N
have	N
to	N
shoot	N
wild	N
predators	N
.	N
	
Most	N
important	N
,	N
said	N
Chapron	N
,	N
is	N
the	N
EU	N
Habitats	N
Directive	N

has	N
forced	N

we	N
would	N
have	N

this	N

,	N
he	N
said	N

It	N
shows	N
that	N
we	N
can	N
protect	N

if	N

Riding	N

Some	N

While	N
cheap	N

She	N

her	N
as	N
a	N
little	N

all.But	N
it	N
was	N
difficult	N

It	N
wasnt	N
easy	N

it	N
wasnt	N

night	N

when	N
there	N
was	N
no-one	N
in	N
the	N
building	N

Inky	N
climbed	N
down	N
the	N
side	N
of	N
the	N
tank	C

travelled	N
across	N
the	N
floor.Rob	N

National	N
Aquarium	N

Napier	N
,	N
said	N
:	N
Octopuses	N
are	N
famous	N
for	N
their	N
ability	N
to	N
escape	N
.	N
	
I	N
dont	N
think	N
he	N
was	N
unhappy	N
with	N
us	N
,	N
or	N
lonely	N
,	N
because	N
octopuses	N
like	N
to	N
live	N
alone	N
.	N
	
But	N
,	N
he	N
is	N
such	C
a	N
curious	N
boy	N
.	N
	
He	N
would	N
want	N
to	N
know	N
whats	N
happening	N
on	N
the	N
outside	N
.	N
	
Thats	N
his	N
personality.One	N
idea	N
is	N
that	N
Inky	N
crossed	N
the	N
aquarium	N
floor	N
a	N
journey	N
of	N
three	N
or	N
four	N
metres	N
and	N
then	N
,	N
he	N
realized	N
that	N
freedom	C
was	N
very	N
near	N
so	N
he	N
entered	N
a	N
drainpipe	N
that	N
led	N
directly	N
to	N
the	N
sea	N
.	N
	
The	N
drainpipe	N
was	N
50	N
metres	N
long	N
and	N
opened	N
into	N
Hawkes	N
Bay	N
,	N
on	N
the	N
east	N
coast	N
of	N
New	N
Zealands	N
North	N
Island.It	N
is	N
also	N
possible	N
that	N
Inky	N
escaped	N
through	N
an	N
open	N
pipe	N
at	N
the	N
top	N
of	N
his	N
tank	C
,	N
which	N
led	N
under	N
the	N
floor	N
to	N
the	N
drain	C
.	N
	
When	N
we	N
came	N
in	N
the	N
next	N
morning	N
and	N
his	N
tank	C
was	N
empty	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
really	N
surprised	N
,	N
said	N
Yarrell	N
,	N
who	N
has	N
not	N
started	N
looking	N
for	N
Inky	N
.	N
	
The	N
staff	N
and	N
I	N
have	N
been	N
sad	N
.	N
	
But	N
then	N
,	N
this	N
is	N
Inky	N
and	N
hes	N
always	N
been	N
a	N
bit	N
of	N
a	N
surprise	N

he	N
was	N
absolutely	N
certain	N
Inky	N
was	N
not	N
stolen	N

I	N
understand	N
octopus	N
behaviour	N
very	N
well	N
,	N
he	N
said	N

I	N
have	N
seen	N
octopuses	N
on	N
boats	N
escape	N
through	N
waste	N
pumps	N
.	N
	
And	N
,	N
the	N
security	N
here	N
is	N
too	N
good	N
for	N
anyone	N
to	N
take	N
Inky	N
and	N
why	N
would	N
they	N
?	N
Because	N
octopuses	N
have	N
no	N
bones	N
,	N
they	N
can	N
fit	N
into	N
very	N
small	N
spaces	N
and	N
can	N
squeeze	C
through	N
gaps	N

They	N
are	N
also	N
very	N

At	N

an	N

visited	N
another	N

every	N

was	N
brought	N
to	N
the	N
National	N
Aquarium	N
several	N
years	N
ago	N
by	N
a	N
local	N
fisherman	C
who	N
found	C
him	N
in	N
a	N
fishing	N
pot	N

Yarrell	N
said	N
,	N
He	N
lived	N
on	N
the	N
reef	N
and	N
fought	N
with	N
fish	N
so	N
he	N
was	N
quite	N
ill	N
.	N
	
According	N
to	N
Yarrell	N
,	N
Inky	N
who	N
is	N
about	N
the	N
size	N
of	N
a	N
rugby	N
ball	N
was	N
an	N
unusually	N
intelligent	N
octopus	N
.	N
	
He	N
was	N
very	N
friendly	N
and	N
a	N
popular	N
attraction	N
here	N
.	N
	
We	N
have	N
another	N
octopus	N
,	N
Blotchy	N
,	N
but	N
he	N
is	N
smaller	N
than	N
Inky	N
and	N
Inky	N
had	N
the	N
personality.The	N
aquarium	N
has	N
no	N
plans	N
to	N
increase	N
security	N
as	N
a	N
result	N
of	N
the	N
escape	N
but	N
the	N
staff	N
now	N
know	N
what	N
octopuses	N
can	N
do	N
so	N
they	N
will	N
be	N
more	N
careful	N
.	N
	
The	N
aquarium	N
is	N
not	N
looking	N
for	N
another	N
octopus	N
but	N
,	N
if	N
a	N
fisherman	C
brought	N
in	N
another	N
octopus	N

the	N

might	N
take	N
it	N

Theres	N
always	N

that	N

adds	N

if	N
Kate	N

British	N

is	N
shocking	N

these	N

In	N
2010	N

a	N

It	N
was	N

If	N

we	N

the	N
Massachusetts	N
Institute	C
of	N
Technology	N
(	N
MIT	N

,	N
and	N
his	N

wanted	N
to	N
study	N
how	N
these	N
false	N

might	N
form	N
in	N
the	N
human	N
brain	N
,	N

they	N
encoded	N

Memories	N

According	N
to	N
Tonagawa	N
,	N
both	N
false	N
and	N
genuine	C

seem	N
to	N
use	N
the	N

the	N

Tonagawas	N

put	N
the	N

in	N
a	N

allowed	N
them	N

explore	N
it	N

As	N
they	N
did	N
so	N
,	N
their	N
brain	N

were	N
producing	N
a	N

protein	C

The	N
next	N
day	N
,	N
the	N
same	N
mice	N
were	N
put	N
in	N
a	N
second	N
box	N
and	N
given	N
a	N
small	N
electric	N
shock	N
,	N
to	N
encode	N
a	N
fear	N
response	C
.	N
	
At	N
the	N
same	N
time	N
,	N
the	N
researchers	N
shone	N
light	N
into	N
the	N
mouse	N
brains	N
to	N
activate	N
their	N
memories	N
of	N
the	N
first	N
box	N
.	N
	
That	N
way	N
,	N
the	N
mice	N
learned	N
to	N
associate	C
fear	N
of	N
the	N
electric	N
shock	N
with	N
the	N
memory	N
of	N
the	N
first	N
box.In	N
the	N
final	N
part	N
of	N
the	N
experiment	N
,	N
the	N
team	N
put	N
the	N
mice	N
back	N
in	N
the	N
first	N
box	N
.	N
	
The	N
mice	N
froze	N
,	N
showing	N
a	N
typical	N
fear	N
response	C
,	N
even	N
though	N
they	N
had	N
never	N
been	N
shocked	N
in	N
that	N
box.A	N
similar	N
process	C
may	N
happen	N
when	N
powerful	N
false	N

are	N
created	N
in	N
humans	N
.	N
	
Humans	N
are	N
very	N
imaginative	C
animals	N
,	N
said	N
Tonagawa	N
.	N
	
So	N
,	N
just	N
like	N
our	N
mouse	N
,	N
it	N
is	N
quite	N
possible	N
we	N
can	N
associate	C
what	N
we	N
happen	N
to	N
have	N
in	N
our	N
mind	N
with	N
bad	N
or	N
good	N
events	N
.	N
	
In	N
other	N
words	N
,	N
there	N
could	N
be	N
a	N
false	N
association	C
of	N
what	N
you	N
have	N
in	N
your	N
mind	N
rather	N
than	N
what	N
is	N
happening	N
to	N
you.He	N
added	N
:	N
Our	N
study	N
showed	N
that	N
the	N
false	N
memory	N
and	N
the	N
genuine	C
memory	N
are	N
based	N
on	N
very	N
similar	N
,	N
almost	N
identical	C
,	N
brain	N
mechanisms	N
.	N
	
It	N
is	N
difficult	N
for	N
the	N
person	N
with	N
false	N
memories	N
to	N
distinguish	C
between	N
them	N
.	N
	
We	N
hope	N
our	N
future	N

along	N
this	N

that	N
the	N

we	N
correctly	N

the	N
report	N
says.Anderson	N
said	N
:	N
First	N
,	N
we	N
looked	N
at	N
how	N
much	N
different	N
body	N
parts	N
showed	N
that	N
someone	N
was	N
lying	N

We	N
found	C
that	N
liars	N
wave	N

more	N

but	N
this	N
is	N
only	N
at	N
the	N
60	N
%	N
level	N
that	N
you	N
can	N
get	N
from	N
a	N
polygraph.The	N
success	N
came	N
when	N
we	N
looked	N
at	N
total	N

That	N
tells	N
truth	C
from	N
lies	N
over	N
70	N
%	N
of	N
the	N
time	N
and	N
we	N
believe	N
we	N
can	N
improve	N
it	N
even	N
more	N
by	N
combining	N
it	N
with	N
optimal	N
questioning	N
techniques.Another	N
advantage	N
is	N
that	N
total	N
body	N
motion	C
is	N
mostly	N
the	N
same	N
in	N
people	N
who	N
have	N
different	N
cultural	N

different	N
levels	N

these	N
things	N

Anderson	N
said.The	N
use	N
of	N
all-body	N

is	N
expensive	N
they	N
cost	N
about	N
30000	N

they	N
can	N
be	N
uncomfortable	N
,	N
so	N
Anderson	N
and	N
his	N
colleagues	N
are	N
now	N
studying	N
low-cost	N
alternatives	N
.	N
	
These	N
include	N
using	N
motion-sensing	N
technology	N
from	N
computer	N
games	N
,	N
such	C
as	N
the	N
Kinect	N

Microsoft	N

the	N
Xbox.Anderson	N
admits	N
that	N
intelligence	C
agencies	N
such	C

the	N
CIA	N
could	N
teach	N
agents	N
how	N
to	N
trick	N
the	N
full-body	N
motion	C
method	N
by	N
keeping	N
their	N
bodies	N
completely	N
still	N
.	N
	
But	N
he	N
said	N
that	N
in	N
itself	N
would	N
be	N
a	N
giveaway	N
.	N
	
A	N
girl	N
born	N
today	N
in	N
the	N
UK	N
can	N
expect	N
to	N
live	N
nearly	N
to	N
the	N
age	N
of	N
82	N
on	N
average	N
and	N
her	N
brother	N
will	N
live	N
to	N
78	N
.	N
	
They	N
would	N
have	N
a	N
longer	N
life	N
in	N
Andorra	N
(	N
85	N
and	N
79	N
respectively	C
)	N
but	N
will	N
live	N
a	N
little	N
longer	N
than	N
in	N
the	N
US	N
(	N
81	N
and	N
76	N
)	N
.	N
	
If	N
they	N
lived	N
in	N
the	N
Central	N
African	N
Republic	C

they	N
would	N
die	N
in	N
middle	C

(	N
49	N

44	N

However	N

almost	N
everywhere	N

,	N
lifespans	N

And	N
the	N
best	N
news	N
is	N
that	N
small	N

much	N
less	N
likely	N
to	N
die	N
than	N
they	N
were	N
forty	N

in	N
some	N

The	N
most	N

result	N

been	N
the	N
malaria	N

IHME	N

1.2	N

twice	N
as	N

The	N
big	N
increase	N
is	N
in	N

It	N
is	N
commonly	C
believed	N
that	N
malaria	N
kills	N
mostly	N
children	N
under	N
five.The	N
way	N
I	N
was	N
taught	N
as	N
a	N
doctor	N
and	N
everybody	N

that	N

in	N

you	N
become	N
semi-immune	N
as	N
an	N
adult	N

Dr	N
Christopher	N

IHME	N

We	N
originally	C
went	N
with	N
that	N
opinion	N
but	N
there	N
has	N
been	N
a	N
change	N
as	N
we	N
have	N
become	N
more	N
empirical	C

His	N

,	N
Director	N

However	N

some	N

that	N

One	N
of	N
the	N

was	N
incredibly	C

the	N

faster	N
than	N
we	N
expected	C
it	N

The	N

went	N
several	N

he	N
was	N

unconscious	C
at	N

also	N

But	N
many	N
of	N
the	N
other	N
injuries	N
were	N
after	N

that	N
the	N

it	N

Baumgartner	N
raised	N
his	N
arms	N
in	N
a	N
victory	C
salute.He	N
was	N
wearing	N
a	N
specially	N

him	N
against	N
the	N

during	N
the	N

Without	N
it	N

his	N
blood	N
would	N
have	N
boiled	N

his	N

Baumgartner	N
later	N
told	N
a	N

conference	N
that	N
all	N
he	N
could	N
think	N
about	N
was	N
getting	N
back	N
alive	N

he	N
added	N
:	N
Sometimes	N
you	N
have	N
to	N
go	N
up	N
really	N
high	N
to	N
see	N
how	N
small	N
you	N
are.His	N
other	N
two	N

the	N

the	N

The	N
jump	N
happened	N
on	N
a	N
sunny	N
morning	N
in	N
good	N
weather	N
.	N
	
Baumgartner	N
was	N
carried	N
up	N
into	N
clear	N
skies	N
by	N
a	N
gigantic	N
balloon	N
it	N
measured	N
30	N
million	N
square	N
cubic	N
feet	N
and	N
its	N
skin	N
was	N
one-tenth	N
the	N
thickness	N
of	N
a	N
sandwich	N
bag	N

At	N
the	N
bottom	N
of	N
the	N
balloon	N
was	N
a	N
capsule	N
,	N
where	N
Baumgartner	N
sat	N
in	N
his	N
suit.As	N
he	N
reached	N
the	N
correct	N
height	N
,	N
Baumgartner	N
went	N
through	N
a	N
checklist	N
of	N
40	N
things	N
with	N
his	N
mentor	N
Joe	N
Kittinger	N
.	N
	
Kittinger	N
was	N
the	N
previous	N
holder	N
of	N
the	N
highest	N
altitude	N

flight.Baumgartner	N
had	N
a	N
problem	N
with	N
his	N
visor	N

This	N
is	N
very	N
serious	N

Joe	N
,	N
he	N
told	N
Kitttinger	N
.	N
	
Sometimes	N
its	N
getting	N
foggy	N
when	N
I	N
breathe	N
out	N

But	N
they	N
decided	N
to	N
go	N
ahead	N

watched	N
by	N
a	N
record	N

up	N

during	N
which	N
the	N
curvature	N
of	N
the	N
Earth	N
became	N
visible	C
and	N
the	N

gradually	C
turned	N

the	N

Three	N

were	N
attached	N

Baumgartners	N

recorded	N
his	N

over	N
four	N

the	N
parachute	C
opening.The	N
success	N
of	N
the	N
mission	C

of	N
the	N

that	N

The	N

once	N
into	N
a	N

He	N

two	N
practice	N
free-falls	N
in	N

for	N
this	N

one	N
from	N
71000	N
feet	N
and	N
a	N
second	N
from	N
97000	N

But	N
nothing	N
can	N
compare	N
with	N
his	N
jump	N
above	N
the	N
town	N
of	N
Roswell	N
,	N
a	N
place	N
famous	N
for	N
its	N

Currently	C
the	N

attracted	N
by	N
the	N
strong	N

years	N
it	N
has	N
been	N
very	N
different	N
from	N
the	N
concrete-lined	N
beaches	N
of	N
Torremolinos	N
and	N
Marbella	N
along	N
the	N
coast	N

but	N
earlier	N
in	N
2012	N
the	N
local	N
council	C
in	N
Tarifa	N
said	N
yes	N
to	N

but	N
for	N
most	N
of	N
the	N
council	C
the	N
issue	N
is	N
simple	N
:	N
jobs	N

Tarifa	N
has	N
18000	N
inhabitants	N
and	N
2600	N
are	N

as	N
Spain	N
experiences	N
its	N
worst	N
economic	C

in	N
at	N

half	N
a	N
century.Traditional	N
jobs	N
such	C
as	N
fishing	N
are	N
dying	N
out	N
so	N
tourism	N
is	N
the	N
only	N
solution	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
must	N
be	N
sustainable	C
,	N
said	N
Sebastin	N
Galindo	N

a	N
councillor	N
from	N
the	N

which	N
is	N

the	N

Galindo	N
says	N
the	N
complex	C
meets	N
environmental	N
standards	N
.	N
	
There	N
is	N
a	N
law	N
that	N
was	N
designed	N
to	N
stop	N
more	N
ugly	N
developments	N
like	N
those	N
that	N
spoilt	N
a	N
lot	N
of	N

beaches	N
when	N
mass	C
tourism	N
first	N
arrived	N
in	N
the	N
1960s	N
and	N
1970s	N
.	N
	
This	N
law	N
says	N
that	N
the	N
complex	C
must	N
be	N
at	N
least	N
200	N
metres	N
from	N
the	N
coast	N
;	N
it	N
will	N
be	N
much	N
farther	N
than	N
that	N
it	N
will	N
be	N
800	N
metres.Opponents	N
of	N
the	N
complex	C
say	N
more	N
housing	C
is	N
not	N
needed	N
in	N
a	N
country	N
that	N
already	N
has	N
a	N
million	N

The	N

In	N
Romevas	N
view	N

another	N
problem	N
with	N
the	N

that	N
the	N

in	N

are	N
also	N
wondering	N
why	N
a	N
resort	N
should	N
be	N
built	N
10km	N

not	N
on	N

We	N
agree	N
with	N
the	N
complex	C
as	N
long	N
as	N
it	N
creates	N
jobs	N
in	N
the	N
town	N

we	N
are	N
against	N
it	N
if	N
it	N

the	N

What	N
they	N

what	N

in	N
November	N

that	N
four	N

close	N
due	N

an	N
out	N

there	N
has	N

no	N
fall	N
in	N

between	N

there	N
was	N
a	N

now	N
a	N
little	N

A	N
similar	N

expected	C
in	N
2013	N

2014	N

Oberg	N
said	N
he	N
was	N
puzzled	C
by	N
the	N
unexpected	N
fall	N

but	N
hoped	N
that	N
the	N
reason	N
was	N
to	N
do	N
with	N
how	N
his	N
prisons	N
are	N
run	N

We	N
certainly	N
hope	N
that	N
the	N
efforts	N
we	N
put	N
into	N
rehabilitation	N
and	N
preventing	N
criminals	N
from	N
reoffending	N
has	N
made	N
a	N
difference	N
,	N
he	N
said.The	N
modern	N
prison	N
service	N
in	N
Sweden	N
is	N
very	N
different	N
from	N
when	N
I	N
joined	N
as	N
a	N
young	N
prison	N
officer	N
in	N
1978	N
,	N
says	N
Kenneth	N
Gustafsson	N
,	N
governor	N
of	N
Kumla	N
Prison	N
,	N
Swedens	N
most	N
secure	C
jail	N
,	N
130	N
miles	C
west	N
of	N
Stockholm	N

However	N
,	N
he	N
doesnt	N
think	N
the	N
system	N
has	N
gone	N
soft	N

When	N
I	N
joined	N
,	N
the	N
focus	C
was	N
very	N
much	N
on	N
humanity	C
in	N
prisons	N

Prisoners	N
were	N
treated	N
well	N
maybe	N
too	N
well	N
,	N
some	N
might	N
say	N

But	N
,	N
after	N
a	N
number	N
of	N
escapes	N
in	N
2004	N
,	N
we	N
had	N
to	N
place	N
more	N
emphasis	C
on	N
security.The	N
Swedes	N
still	N
have	N
a	N
humane	N
approach	N
to	N

even	N
of	N
the	N
most	N
serious	N
offenders	N
:	N
jail	N
sentences	N
are	N
not	N

more	N

ten	N

Those	N
who	N

can	N
still	N
apply	N
to	N
the	N
courts	N
after	N
a	N
decade	C
to	N
have	N
the	N
sentence	N
changed	N
to	N
a	N

usually	N
between	N
18	N

25	N
years	N

Sweden	N
was	N
the	N
first	N
country	N
in	N

to	N
introduce	N
the	N

One	N
thing	N
that	N

down	N

the	N

countries	N

they	N
try	N
to	N
keep	N
young	N
offenders	N
out	N
of	N
prison.One	N
strong	N
reason	N
for	N
the	N
fall	N
in	N
prison	N
numbers	N
might	N
be	N
the	N
amount	N
of	N
post-prison	N
support	N
available	N
in	N
Sweden	N

A	N
government-run	N
probation	N

runs	N
a	N
group	N

Peter	N

almost	N
three	N

a	N

And	N
what	N
is	N

for	N
the	N

When	N
I	N
was	N

I	N
was	N
lucky	N

Soderlund	N

In	N

where	N
I	N
served	N
my	N
sentence	N

we	N
were	N
treated	N
well	N

But	N
I	N
knew	N
that	N
not	N
all	N
Swedish	N
prisons	N
were	N
like	N
that	N

I	N
met	N

needed	N

wanted	N

With	N
X-Cons	N

we	N
meet	N
them	N
at	N
the	N
prison	N

support	N
them	N
into	N
accommodation	N
and	N
offer	N
a	N
network	C

support.In	N
Sweden	N
,	N
we	N
believe	N
very	N
much	N
in	N
the	N
idea	N

rehabilitation	N
,	N
says	N
Gustafsson	N

Of	N

there	N
are	N
some	N
people	N
who	N
will	N
not	N
or	N
can	N
not	N
change	N

But	N
,	N
in	N
my	N
experience	N
,	N
the	N
majority	C
of	N
prisoners	N
want	N
to	N
change	N
and	N
we	N
must	N
do	N
what	N
we	N
can	N
to	N

them	N

The	N
first	N
one	N
we	N

was	N
in	N
2012	N
,	N
Creative	N

for	N
Grown-Ups	N
.	N
	
It	N
sold	N
well	N
but	N
it	N
was	N
in	N
2014	N
that	N
it	N
all	N
really	N
mushroomed	N
with	N
Art	N
Therapy	C
.	N
	
It	N
became	N
really	N
popular	N
selling	N
it	N
as	N
an	N
anti-stress	N
book	N
gave	N
people	N
permission	N
to	N
enjoy	N
something	N
they	N
might	N
have	N
felt	N
was	N
quite	N
childish	C
,	N
she	N
said.The	N
Mindfulness	N
Colouring	N
Book	N
really	N
emphasizes	N
that	N
it	N
is	N
anti-stress	N
its	N
publisher	C
tells	N
readers	N
that	N
it	N
is	N
filled	N
with	N
templates	N
for	N
exquisite	C
scenes	N
and	N
intricate	N
,	N
sophisticated	C
patterns	N
,	N
prompting	N
you	N
to	N
meditate	N
on	N
your	N
artwork	N
as	N
you	N
mindfully	N
and	N
creatively	C
fill	N
these	N
pages	N
with	N
colour	N
.	N
	
It	N
suggests	N
that	N
colourers	N
take	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
out	N
of	N
your	N
day	N
,	N
wherever	N
you	N
are	N
,	N
and	N
colour	N
your	N
way	N
to	N
peace	N
and	N
calm.I	N
think	N
it	N
is	N
really	N
relaxing	N
to	N
unplug	N
,	N
said	N
Basford	N
.	N
	
And	N
its	N
creative	N
.	N
	
For	N
many	N
people	N
,	N
a	N
blank	N
sheet	N
is	N
very	N
daunting	N
;	N
with	N
a	N
colouring	N
book	N
,	N
you	N
just	N
need	N
to	N
bring	N
the	N
colour	N
.	N
	
Also	N
,	N
theres	N
a	N
bit	N
of	N
nostalgia	C
there	N
.	N
	
So	N
many	N
people	N
have	N
said	N
to	N
me	N
that	N
they	N
used	N
to	N
do	N
secret	N
colouring	N
in	N
when	N
their	N
kids	N
were	N
in	N
bed	N
.	N
	
Now	N
,	N
it	N
is	N
socially	N
acceptable	N
;	N
its	N
a	N
category	C
of	N
its	N
own	N
.	N
	
These	N
are	N
books	N
for	N
adults	N
.	N
	
The	N
art	N
in	N
my	N
books	N
is	N
super	N
intricate.The	N
illustrator	N
,	N
who	N
lives	N
in	N
Aberdeenshire	N
,	N
has	N
been	N
astonished	C
at	N
the	N
reaction	C
since	N
she	N
released	N
Secret	N
Garden	N
in	N
2013	N
.	N
	
I	N
drew	N
a	N
kids	N
book	N
and	N
I	N
told	N
them	N
I	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
do	N
one	N
for	N
grown-ups	N
.	N
	
It	N
really	N
wasnt	N
a	N
trend	N
then	N
.	N
	
I	N
drew	N
the	N
first	N
story	N
and	N
they	N
said	N
,	N
Lets	N
go	N
for	N
it	N
.	N
	
I	N
was	N
thinking	N
simply	C
that	N
people	N
like	N
me	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
do	N
it	N
.	N
	
My	N
intention	C
was	N
just	N
to	N
make	N
a	N
book	N
I	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
have	N
.	N
	
So	N
its	N
been	N
a	N
real	N
surprise	N
to	N
see	N
the	N
category	C
bloom.She	N
is	N
currently	C
working	N
on	N
a	N
third	N
book	N

Its	N
a	N
major	C
trend	N
and	N
it	N
doesnt	N
look	N
like	N
its	N
going	N
to	N
slow	N
down	N
