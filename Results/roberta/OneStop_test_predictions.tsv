added	N	N
:	N	N
Sometimes	N	N
you	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N

up	N	N

Baumgartner	N	N
was	N	N
carried	N	N
up	N	N
into	N	N
crystal	C	C

skies	N	N
by	N	N
a	N	N
gigantic	N	C
balloon	N	C

which	N	N
measured	N	N
30	N	N
million	N	N
square	N	N

Baumgartner	N	N
went	N	N
through	N	N

There	N	N
was	N	N
some	N	N
concern	C	C

a	N	N
heater	N	C

Sometimes	N	N
its	N	N

1.9	N	N

This	N	N
would	N	N
lead	N	N
to	N	N
an	N	N
approximately	N	C
twofold	N	C

A	N	N
company	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
Netherlands	N	N
wants	N	N
to	N	N
turn	N	N
dreams	N	N
of	N	N
reaching	N	N
Mars	N	N
into	N	N
reality	C	N
.	N	N

The	N	N
company	N	N
nan	N	N
Mars	N	N
One	N	N
nan	N	N
plans	N	N
to	N	N
send	N	N
four	N	N
astronauts	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
Red	N	N
Planet	N	N
to	N	N
build	N	N
a	N	N
human	N	N
colony	N	C
in	N	N
2023	N	N
.	N	N

But	N	N
there	N	N
are	N	N
two	N	N
serious	N	N
problems	N	N
.	N	N

Firstly	C	C
nan	N	N
on	N	N
Mars	N	N
the	N	N
astronauts	N	C
bodies	N	N
will	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
adapt	C	C
to	N	N
gravity	N	C
that	N	N
is	N	N
38	N	N
%	N	N
of	N	N
gravity	N	C
on	N	N
Earth	N	N
.	N	N

This	N	N
would	N	N
probably	N	N
cause	C	N
such	C	N
a	N	N
total	N	N
change	N	N
in	N	N
their	N	N
bones	N	N
nan	N	N
muscles	N	N
and	N	N
circulation	C	C
that	N	N
the	N	N
astronauts	N	C
would	N	N
no	N	N
longer	N	N
be	N	N
able	C	N
to	N	N
survive	C	C
on	N	N
Earth	N	N
.	N	N

Secondly	C	C
nan	N	N
they	N	N
will	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
say	N	N
goodbye	N	N
to	N	N
all	N	N
their	N	N
family	N	N
and	N	N
friends	N	N
nan	N	N
because	N	N
there	N	N
is	N	N
no	N	N
return	N	N
ticket	N	N
.	N	N

The	N	N
Mars	N	N
One	N	N
website	N	N
says	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
astronauts	N	C
can	N	N
not	N	N
expect	N	N
to	N	N
return	N	N
.	N	N

To	N	N
return	N	N
nan	N	N
they	N	N
would	N	N
need	N	N
a	N	N
rocket	C	C
that	N	N
can	N	N
leave	N	N
Mars	N	N
.	N	N

The	N	N
rocket	C	C
would	N	N
need	N	N
life	N	N
support	N	N
systems	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
seven-month	N	N
journey	N	C
and	N	N
would	N	N
need	N	N
to	N	N
either	N	N
join	N	N
up	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
space	N	N
station	N	N
or	N	N
land	N	N
safely	N	N
on	N	N
Earth	N	N
.	N	N

But	N	N
the	N	N
project	N	N
has	N	N
already	N	N
had	N	N
10000	N	N
applicants	N	C
nan	N	N
according	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
companys	N	N
Medical	C	N
Director	N	N
nan	N	N
Norbert	N	N
Kraft	N	N
.	N	N

He	N	N
told	N	N
The	N	N
Guardian	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
applicants	N	C
so	N	N
far	N	N
were	N	N
aged	N	N
18	N	N
to	N	N
at	N	N
least	N	N
62	N	N
and	N	N
nan	N	C
although	N	N
they	N	N
include	N	N
women	N	N
nan	N	N
they	N	N
were	N	N
mostly	N	N
men	N	N
.	N	N

Mars	N	N
One	N	N
says	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
astronauts	N	C
must	N	N
be	N	N
resilient	C	C
nan	N	N
adaptable	N	C
nan	N	N
curious	N	C
nan	N	N
trusting	N	C
and	N	N
resourceful	C	C
.	N	N

They	N	N
must	N	N
also	N	N
be	N	N
over	N	N
18	N	N
.	N	N

Mars	N	N
One	N	N
says	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
basic	N	C
things	N	N
people	N	N
need	N	N
to	N	N
live	N	N
are	N	N
already	N	N
present	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
planet	N	N
.	N	N

For	N	N
example	N	N
nan	N	N
they	N	N
can	N	N
take	N	N
water	N	N
from	N	N

the	N	N
primary	C	C
element	C	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
air	N	N
we	N	N
breathe	N	N

The	N	N
colony	N	C
will	N	N
use	N	N
solar	C	N

to	N	N
get	N	N
power	N	N

The	N	N
project	N	C
will	N	N
cost	N	N

When	N	N

became	N	N
a	N	N
doctor	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
1990s	N	N
nan	N	N
I	N	N
learnt	N	N
about	N	N
Methicillin	N	C
Resistant	N	C

is	N	N

is	N	N
resistant	N	C
to	N	N
methicillin	N	C

all	N	N

penicillins	N	C

There	N	N
were	N	N
just	N	N
a	N	N

could	N	N

it	N	N

nan	N	N
vancomycin	N	N
and	N	N
teicoplanin	N	C

But	N	N
antibiotic	C	C
resistant	N	C
bacteria	C	C
became	N	N
more	N	N
and	N	N
more	N	N
common	N	N
.	N	N

In	N	N
our	N	N
hospitals	N	N
and	N	N
our	N	N
doctors	N	N

we	N	N
use	N	N
antiobiotics	N	C

Also	N	N
nan	N	N
we	N	N
have	N	N
put	N	N

food	N	N
chain	N	N
nan	N	N
when	N	N
we	N	N
grow	N	N

put	N	N
anti-bacterial	N	C
drugs	N	N
into	N	N
food	N	N
for	N	N

We	N	N
thought	N	N
that	N	N
antibiotics	N	C
were	N	N
something	N	N
we	N	N
could	N	N
use	N	N
forever	N	N

We	N	N
thought	N	N
that	N	N

would	N	N
continue	N	N

make	N	N
more	N	N

more	N	N

But	N	N
this	N	N
is	N	N
no	N	N

have	N	N
found	C	N

The	N	N
vancomycin	N	C
that	N	N

to	N	N
treat	C	N

Today	N	N

It	N	N
is	N	N
more	N	N

more	N	N
difficult	N	N
to	N	N
develop	N	N
new	N	N
drugs	N	N
that	N	N
can	N	N
kill	N	N

Antibiotics	N	C

And	N	N
we	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N

national	N	N
manager	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
National	N	N
Aquarium	N	C
of	N	N
New	N	N
Zealand	N	N
in	N	N
Napier	N	N
nan	N	N
said	N	N
:	N	N
Octopuses	N	C
are	N	N
famous	N	N
for	N	N
their	N	N
ability	N	N
to	N	N
escape	N	C
.	N	N

I	N	N
dont	N	N
think	N	N
he	N	N
was	N	N
unhappy	N	N
with	N	N
us	N	N
nan	N	N
or	N	N
lonely	N	C
nan	N	N
because	N	N
octopuses	N	C
like	N	N
to	N	N
live	N	N
alone	N	N
.	N	N

But	N	N
nan	N	N
he	N	N
is	N	N
such	C	N
a	N	N
curious	N	C
boy	N	N
.	N	N

He	N	N
would	N	N
want	N	N
to	N	N
know	N	N
whats	N	N
happening	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
outside	N	N
.	N	N

Thats	N	N
his	N	N
personality	C	C
.	N	N

One	N	N
idea	N	C
is	N	N
that	N	N
Inky	N	N
crossed	N	N
the	N	N
aquarium	N	C
floor	N	N
a	N	N
journey	N	C
of	N	N
three	N	N
or	N	N
four	N	N
metres	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
nan	N	N
he	N	N
realized	N	N
that	N	N
freedom	C	C
was	N	N
very	N	N
near	N	N
so	N	N
he	N	N
entered	N	C
a	N	N
drainpipe	N	C
that	N	N
led	N	N
directly	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
sea	N	N
.	N	N

The	N	N
drainpipe	N	C
was	N	N
50	N	N
metres	N	N
long	N	N
and	N	N
opened	N	N
into	N	N
Hawkes	N	N
Bay	N	N
nan	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
east	N	N
coast	N	N
of	N	N
New	N	N
Zealands	N	N
North	N	N
Island	N	N
.	N	N

It	N	N
is	N	N
also	N	N
possible	N	N
that	N	N
Inky	N	N
escaped	N	C
through	N	N
an	N	N
open	N	N
pipe	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
top	N	N
of	N	N
his	N	N
tank	C	C
nan	N	N
which	N	N
led	N	N
under	N	N
the	N	N
floor	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
drain	C	C
.	N	N

When	N	N
we	N	N
came	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
next	N	N
morning	N	N
and	N	N
his	N	N
tank	C	N
was	N	N
empty	N	N
nan	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
really	N	N
surprised	N	C
nan	N	N
said	N	N
Yarrell	N	N
nan	N	N
who	N	N
has	N	N
not	N	N
started	N	N
looking	N	N
for	N	N
Inky	N	N
.	N	N

The	N	N
staff	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
have	N	N
been	N	N
sad	N	N
.	N	N

But	N	N
then	N	N
nan	N	N
this	N	N
is	N	N
Inky	N	N
and	N	N
hes	N	N
always	N	N
been	N	N

not	N	N

I	N	N

very	N	N
well	N	N
nan	N	N

And	N	N
nan	N	N
the	N	N
security	N	N
here	N	N
is	N	N
too	N	N
good	N	N
for	N	N
anyone	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
Inky	N	N
and	N	N
why	N	N
would	N	N
they	N	N
?	N	N
Because	N	N
octopuses	N	C
have	N	N
no	N	N
bones	N	N
nan	N	N
they	N	N
can	N	N
fit	N	N
into	N	N

Yarrell	N	N
said	N	N
nan	N	N
He	N	N
lived	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
reef	N	C
and	N	N
fought	N	N
with	N	N
fish	N	N
so	N	N
he	N	N
was	N	N
quite	N	N
ill	N	N

According	N	N
to	N	N
Yarrell	N	N
nan	N	N
Inky	N	N
who	N	N
is	N	N
about	N	N
the	N	N

was	N	N
very	N	N

We	N	N
have	N	N
another	N	N

Blotchy	N	N
nan	N	N
but	N	N
he	N	N
is	N	N
smaller	N	N

Inky	N	N

Inky	N	N
had	N	N
the	N	N

The	N	N

has	N	N
no	N	N

to	N	N

a	N	N

the	N	N
staff	N	N
now	N	N
know	N	N
what	N	N
octopuses	N	C
can	N	N
do	N	N
so	N	N
they	N	N
will	N	N
be	N	N
more	N	N
careful	N	N

The	N	N

not	N	N

when	N	N

nan	N	N
