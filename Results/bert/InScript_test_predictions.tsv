After	N	N
playing	N	N
football	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
friends	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
all	N	N
sweaty	N	C
and	N	N
dirty	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
decide	N	N
I	N	N
should	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
there	N	N
were	N	N
clean	N	N
towels	N	N
available	N	N
and	N	N
enough	N	N
soap	N	N
and	N	N
shampoo	N	C
to	N	N
thoroughly	C	C
clean	N	N
my	N	N
skin	N	N
and	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
plug	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
bottom	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
bath	N	N
tub	N	N
and	N	N
turned	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
,	N	N
being	N	N
careful	N	N
to	N	N
adjust	C	C
the	N	N
water	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
warm	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
no	N	N
too	N	N
hot	N	N
,	N	N
temperature	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
used	N	N
my	N	N
finger	N	N
to	N	N
determine	C	C
just	N	N
the	N	N
right	N	N
temperature	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
removing	N	C
my	N	N
clothes	N	N
and	N	N
placing	N	N
them	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
hamper	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
carefully	N	C
stepped	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
,	N	N
being	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
steady	C	C
myself	N	N
as	N	N
I	N	N
entered	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
gingerly	N	C
lowered	N	C
myself	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
nice	N	N
warm	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
immediately	N	N
began	N	N
to	N	N
relax	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
minutes	N	N
of	N	N
rest	N	N
and	N	N
relaxation	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
soap	N	N
and	N	N
thoroughly	C	C
washed	N	N
my	N	N
whole	N	N
body	N	N
,	N	N
making	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
all	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
dirt	N	N
and	N	N
grass	N	N
stains	N	C
off	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
accumulated	N	C
from	N	N
playing	N	N
football	N	N
.	N	N
	
Next	N	N
I	N	N
washed	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
with	N	N
shampoo	N	C
and	N	N
laid	N	N
back	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
to	N	N
really	N	N
rinse	N	C
it	N	N
out	N	N
well	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
carefully	N	C
exited	N	C
the	N	N
bath	N	N
tub	N	N
,	N	N
making	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
step	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N
bath	N	N
mat	C	C
so	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
n't	N	N
slip	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
smooth	N	N
floor	N	N
tiles	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
a	N	N
towel	N	N
and	N	N
dried	N	N
myself	N	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
Now	N	N
my	N	N
bath	N	N
was	N	N
complete	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
felt	N	N
so	N	N
nice	N	N
and	N	N
clean	N	N
!	N	N
What	N	N
a	N	N
great	N	N
feeling	N	N
!	N	N
I	N	N
like	N	N
taking	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
instead	N	C
of	N	N
a	N	N
shower	N	N
sometimes	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
start	N	N
by	N	N
closing	N	N
the	N	N
drain	C	C
at	N	N
the	N	N
bottom	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
.	N	N
	
Some	N	N
tubs	N	C
have	N	N
a	N	N
stopper	N	C
and	N	N
some	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
thing	N	N
you	N	N
push	N	N
down	N	N
to	N	N
close	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
it	N	N
's	N	N
closed	N	N
I	N	N
like	N	N
to	N	N
run	N	N
both	N	N
hot	N	N
and	N	N
cold	N	N
water	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
warm	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
I	N	N
let	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
fill	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
about	N	N
a	N	N
hand	N	N
's	N	N
height	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
top	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
.	N	N
	
While	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
is	N	N
running	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
squirt	N	C
in	N	N
bubbles	N	C
and	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
clean	N	N
washcloth	N	N
and	N	N
towel	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
I	N	N
carefully	N	C
climb	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
wash	N	N
my	N	N
whole	N	N
body	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
soap	N	N
and	N	N
washcloth	N	N
,	N	N
even	N	N
behind	N	N
my	N	N
ears	N	N
and	N	N
between	N	N
my	N	N
toes	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
can	N	N
either	N	N
soak	C	C
and	N	N
relax	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
or	N	N
I	N	N
can	N	N
play	N	N
with	N	N
toys	N	N
.	N	N
	
Fun	N	N
toys	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
bathtub	N	C
are	N	N
boats	N	N
and	N	N
plastic	N	C
water	N	N
animals	N	N
like	N	N
whales	N	N
and	N	N
ducks	N	N

Once	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
starts	N	N
to	N	N
turn	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
cold	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
's	N	N
time	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
out	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
open	N	N
the	N	N
drain	C	C
again	N	N
and	N	N
let	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
empty	N	C
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
While	N	N
it	N	N
's	N	N
draining	N	C
I	N	N
carefully	N	N
stand	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
reach	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
towel	N	N
to	N	N
dry	N	N
off	N	N

I	N	N
always	N	N
be	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
is	N	N
clean	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
'm	N	N
finished	N	N
,	N	N
with	N	N
toys	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
dirty	N	N
washcloth	N	N
put	N	N
where	N	N
they	N	N
belong	C	N

Last	N	N
night	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N

I	N	N
take	N	N

time	N	N
to	N	N
relax	N	N
and	N	N
soak	C	C
in	N	N
bubbles	N	C

Baths	N	C
are	N	N
important	N	N
for	N	N
good	N	N
hygiene	C	C
and	N	N
self	C	N
esteem	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
always	N	N
feel	N	N
so	N	N
much	N	N
better	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
am	N	N
clean	N	N
and	N	N
smell	N	N
like	N	N
my	N	N
favorite	N	N

I	N	N
like	N	N
to	N	N
fill	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
up	N	N
as	N	N
full	N	N
as	N	N
I	N	N
can	N	N
and	N	N
pick	N	N

and	N	N
enjoy	N	N

wash	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N

After	N	N

If	N	N

time	N	N

Showers	N	C

No	N	N

I	N	N
went	N	N

and	N	N
started	N	N
to	N	N
run	N	N
the	N	N

,	N	N
letting	N	N
the	N	N

Once	N	N

Suds	N	C
filled	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
along	N	N
with	N	N
warm	N	N
water	N	N
,	N	N
creating	N	N
a	N	N
heavenly	C	C
scent	C	C

Once	N	N
the	N	N

filled	N	N

I	N	N
disrobed	N	C

After	N	N

I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
bar	N	N
of	N	N
soap	N	N
and	N	N
lathered	N	C
my	N	N
body	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
washed	N	N
myself	N	N
carefully	N	N
because	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
not	N	N
want	N	N
to	N	N
spill	N	C
water	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N
floor	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
washed	N	N

After	N	N

Since	N	N

I	N	N
then	N	N

Each	N	N

I	N	N

The	N	N

I	N	N
then	N	N
put	N	N

I	N	N

Once	N	N

bathroom	N	N
door	N	N
.	N	N
	
About	N	N
5	N	N
minutes	N	N
later	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
was	N	N
filled	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
shut	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
briefly	N	C
tested	N	C
the	N	N
water	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
elbow	N	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
stepped	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
to	N	N
lay	N	N
down	N	N
.	N	N
	
For	N	N
about	N	N
25	N	N
minutes	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
lay	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
and	N	N
relaxed	N	C
by	N	N
closing	N	N
my	N	N
eyes	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
also	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
time	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
pages	N	N
of	N	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
brought	N	N
with	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
my	N	N
body	N	N
was	N	N
totally	N	N
relaxed	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
quick	N	N
shower	N	N
to	N	N
rinse	N	C
myself	N	N
off	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
drained	N	C
the	N	N
tub	N	N
.	N	N
	
Next	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
dried	N	N
myself	N	N
off	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
towel	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
clothes	N	N
back	N	N
on	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
great	N	N
relaxing	N	C
experience	N	N
after	N	N
exercising	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
cold	N	N
winter	N	N
day	N	N
.	N	N
	
Last	N	N
night	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
chose	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
because	N	N
I	N	N
find	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
more	N	N
relaxing	N	C
at	N	N
bed	N	N
time	N	N
than	N	N
taking	N	N
a	N	N
shower	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
up	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
bun	C	C
so	N	N
it	N	N
would	N	N
stay	N	N
dry	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
stuck	C	N
the	N	N
stopper	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
drain	C	C
so	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
would	N	N
stay	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
turned	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
faucets	N	C
and	N	N
felt	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
until	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
the	N	N
right	N	N
temperature	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
the	N	N
bath	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
hot	N	N
so	N	N
it	N	N
would	N	N
n't	N	N
get	N	N
cold	N	N
too	N	N
fast	N	N
.	N	N
	
While	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
was	N	N
running	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
bottle	N	N
of	N	N
bubble	C	C
bath	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
closet	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
opened	N	N
it	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
squirted	N	C
a	N	N
little	N	N
bit	N	N
of	N	N
bubble	C	C
bath	N	N
under	N	N
the	N	N
running	N	N
water	N	N
so	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
would	N	N
get	N	N
nice	N	N
and	N	N
foamy	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
took	N	N
out	N	N
a	N	N
fresh	N	N
towel	N	N
and	N	N
a	N	N
loofah	N	C
sponge	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
stepped	N	N
over	N	N
the	N	N
edge	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
and	N	N
sunk	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
slowly	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
hot	N	N
water	N	N
felt	N	N
so	N	N
good	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
skin	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
instantly	C	C
felt	N	N
relaxed	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
bar	N	N
of	N	N
soap	N	N
and	N	N
rubbed	N	N
some	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
loofah	N	C
before	N	N
scrubbing	N	C
down	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
scrub	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
soaked	C	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
and	N	N
relaxed	N	C
for	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
twenty	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
pulled	N	N
the	N	N
stopper	N	C
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
and	N	N
sat	N	N
there	N	N
while	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
went	N	N
down	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
was	N	N
almost	N	N
all	N	N
gone	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
very	N	N
carefully	N	N
stood	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
blotted	N	C
myself	N	N
dry	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
towel	N	N
.	N	N
	
Finally	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
bathrobe	N	C
and	N	N
headed	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
room	N	N
.	N	N
	
Last	N	N
night	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
plugged	N	C
the	N	N
bath	N	N
drain	C	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
filled	N	C
the	N	N
bathtub	N	C
with	N	N
warm	N	N
water	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
poured	N	C
some	N	N
bubble	C	C
bath	N	N
mixture	C	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
while	N	N
the	N	N
bath	N	N
was	N	N
filling	N	C
so	N	N
that	N	N
my	N	N
bath	N	N
would	N	N
have	N	N
bubbles	N	C
.	N	N
	
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
got	N	N
undressed	C	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
bath	N	N
was	N	N
full	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
turned	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
climbed	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
warm	N	N
tub	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
felt	N	N
very	N	N
relaxed	N	C
as	N	N
I	N	N
lay	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
warm	N	N
bubble	C	C
bath	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
shut	N	N
my	N	N
eyes	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
moment	N	N
to	N	N
enjoy	N	C
the	N	N
sensation	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
washed	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
,	N	N
lathering	N	C
the	N	N
shampoo	N	C
into	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
,	N	N
then	N	N
rinsing	N	C
it	N	N
off	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
bath	N	N
water	N	N
.	N	N
	
Next	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
washed	N	N
my	N	N
whole	N	N
body	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
bar	N	N
of	N	N
soap	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
completely	N	N
clean	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
stepped	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
bath	N	N
and	N	N
wrapped	N	N
a	N	N
towel	N	N
around	N	N
myself	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
wrapped	N	N
a	N	N
second	N	N
towel	N	C
around	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
to	N	N
keep	N	N
it	N	N
from	N	N
dripping	N	C
everywhere	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
unplugged	N	C
the	N	N
bath	N	N
drain	C	C
to	N	N
let	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
drain	C	C
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
.	N	N
	
Taking	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
can	N	N
be	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
relaxing	N	C
thing	N	N
to	N	N
do	N	N
especially	N	C
right	N	N
before	N	N
bed	N	N

You	N	N
can	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
to	N	N
clean	N	N
yourself	N	N
or	N	N
just	N	N
to	N	N
soak	C	C
and	N	N
relax	N	N
but	N	N
both	N	N
can	N	N
be	N	N
an	N	N
enjoyable	N	C
experience	N	N
.	N	N
	
Get	N	N
your	N	N
needed	N	N
items	N	C
together	N	N
first	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
will	N	N
include	N	N
a	N	N

drying	N	N

any	N	N
personal	N	N
body	N	N
supplies	N	N
such	C	N

soaps	N	C

You	N	N
may	N	N
want	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
quick	N	N
shower	N	N
off	N	N
first	N	N
so	N	N
that	N	N
your	N	N
bath	N	N
water	N	N
stays	N	N
clean	N	N
as	N	N
you	N	N
soak	C	C

You	N	N
will	N	N
want	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
is	N	N
clean	N	N
first	N	N

you	N	N
might	N	N
want	N	N
to	N	N
wipe	C	N
the	N	N
bottom	N	N
and	N	N
sides	N	N
off	N	N

When	N	N
you	N	N
are	N	N

with	N	N
water	N	N
using	N	N
a	N	N
temperature	N	C

but	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
you	N	N
have	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
plug	N	C
in	N	N
so	N	N
your	N	N
water	N	N
does	N	N
not	N	N
drain	C	C
away	N	N

Its	N	N

When	N	N
taking	N	N
a	N	N

relaxing	N	C
atmosphere	N	C
is	N	N
also	N	N

You	N	N

Candle	N	C

are	N	N
always	N	N
nice	N	N
too	N	N

We	N	N
had	N	N
just	N	N
come	N	N
home	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
beach	N	N
one	N	N
Saturday	N	N
afternoon	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
great	N	N
time	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
were	N	N
very	N	N
sweaty	N	C

After	N	N
unpacking	N	C
the	N	N
car	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
love	N	N
our	N	N
deep	N	N
soaking	C	C
tub	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
put	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
drain	C	C
plug	N	C
and	N	N
started	N	N
running	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
,	N	N
making	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
temperature	N	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
was	N	N
just	N	N
right	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
favorite	N	N

soap	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
was	N	N
full	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
immersed	N	C
myself	N	N
deep	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
and	N	N
just	N	N
let	N	N
my	N	N
body	N	N
soak	C	C
for	N	N
a	N	N
while	N	N

It	N	N
was	N	N

to	N	N
sit	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
nice	N	N
,	N	N
warm	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
let	N	N
everything	N	N
just	N	N
relax	N	N
and	N	N
melt	C	C
away	N	N
from	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
washed	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
favorite	N	N
shampoo	N	C
,	N	N
as	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
lot	N	N
of	N	N
sand	N	N
in	N	N
it	N	N
from	N	N
playing	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
beach	N	N
that	N	N
day	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
scrubbed	N	C
my	N	N
body	N	N
well	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
washcloth	N	N
,	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
off	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
sand	N	N
and	N	N
ocean	N	N
salt	N	N
that	N	N
had	N	N
dried	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
skin	N	N
,	N	N
along	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
sunscreen	N	C
that	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
been	N	N
using	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
relaxing	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
felt	N	N
really	N	N
good	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
pulled	N	N
the	N	N
drain	C	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
and	N	N
let	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
dirty	N	N
water	N	N
go	N	N
down	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
big	N	N
,	N	N
fluffy	N	C
bath	N	N
towel	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
dried	N	N
off	N	N
in	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
on	N	N
clean	N	N
clothes	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
ready	N	N
to	N	N
finish	N	N
up	N	N
our	N	N
fun	N	N
day	N	N
with	N	N
some	N	N
dinner	N	N
and	N	N
good	N	N
times	C	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
family	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
a	N	N
long	N	N
day	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
changed	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
clothes	N	N
into	N	N
a	N	N
plush	N	C
bathrobe	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
placed	N	N
a	N	N
plug	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
drain	C	C
so	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
could	N	N
fill	N	N
up	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
turned	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
adjusted	N	C
it	N	N
so	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
just	N	N
the	N	N
right	N	N
temperature	N	C
-	N	N
hot	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
not	N	N
too	N	N
hot	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
sprinkled	N	C
in	N	N
some	N	N
lavender	N	C
scented	N	C
bath	N	N
salts	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
it	N	N
extra	N	N
relaxing	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
took	N	N
about	N	N
five	N	N
minutes	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
whole	N	N
tub	N	C
to	N	N
fill	N	N
up	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
did	N	N
n't	N	N
fill	N	N
it	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
way	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
top	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
leave	N	N
some	N	N
room	N	N
since	N	N
I	N	N
'd	N	N

When	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
ready	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
dipped	N	C
my	N	N
toe	N	N
in	N	N
first	N	N
,	N	N
testing	N	C
out	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N

I	N	N
hung	N	C

the	N	N
back	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
door	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
eased	N	C
in	N	N
slowly	N	N
since	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
was	N	N
hot	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
nestled	N	C
in	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
washed	N	N
myself	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
washcloth	N	C
and	N	N
soap	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
leaned	N	N
my	N	N
head	N	N
against	N	N
the	N	N
rim	N	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
bathtub	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
breathed	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
aroma	N	C
of	N	N
lavender	N	C
,	N	N
closed	N	N
my	N	N
eyes	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
felt	N	N
my	N	N
body	N	N
and	N	N
mind	N	N
completely	N	N
relax	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
going	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
gym	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
knew	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bathroom	N	N
and	N	N
turned	N	N
the	N	N
faucet	N	C
on	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
while	N	N
plugging	N	C
the	N	N
drain	C	C
to	N	N
fill	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
was	N	N
at	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
level	N	N
I	N	N
shut	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
off	N	N
all	N	N
my	N	N
dirty	N	N
gym	N	N
clothes	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
temperature	N	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
was	N	N
nice	N	N
and	N	N
warm	N	N
before	N	N
I	N	N
slowly	N	N
got	N	N
inside	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
soaked	C	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
while	N	N
before	N	N
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
bar	N	N
of	N	N
soap	N	N
and	N	N
scrubbed	N	C
and	N	N
cleaned	N	N
my	N	N
body	N	N
with	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
also	N	N
used	N	N
some	N	N
shampoo	N	C
to	N	N
clean	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
dipping	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
to	N	N
rinse	N	C
all	N	N
the	N	N
shampoo	N	C
and	N	N
soap	N	N
off	N	N
my	N	N
body	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
unplugged	N	C
the	N	N

and	N	N
emptied	N	C
the	N	N
water	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
out	N	N
and	N	N
dried	N	N
myself	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
towel	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
sure	N	N
made	N	N
me	N	N
feel	N	N
a	N	N
lot	N	N
better	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
clean	N	N
after	N	N
a	N	N
workout	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
a	N	N
long	N	N
day	N	N
of	N	N
work	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
sore	N	C
and	N	N
tired	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
stood	N	C

five	N	N
hours	N	N
straight	N	N
and	N	N
was	N	N
constantly	C	C
helping	N	N
customers	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
floor	N	N
.	N	N
	
Retail	C	C
is	N	N
difficult	N	N
and	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
painful	N	C
for	N	N
my	N	N
feet	N	N
because	N	N
I	N	N
often	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
wear	N	N
high	N	N
heels	N	N
everyday	N	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
finally	N	N
got	N	N
home	N	N
from	N	N
work	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
stuff	N	N
down	N	N
and	N	N
began	N	N
to	N	N
change	N	N
into	N	N
more	N	N
comfortable	N	C
attire	N	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bathroom	N	N
and	N	N
turned	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
hot	N	N

While	N	N
that	N	N
happened	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
washed	N	N
my	N	N
face	N	N
and	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
makeup	N	C
off	N	N
my	N	N
face	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
cleaned	N	N
my	N	N
face	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
crawled	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
shower	N	N
and	N	N
allowed	N	N
the	N	N
hot	N	N
water	N	N

calm	N	C
my	N	N
body	N	N
down	N	N
and	N	N
help	N	N
me	N	N
relax	N	N

I	N	N
put	N	N
shampoo	N	C
on	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
and	N	N
washed	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
and	N	N
massaged	N	C
my	N	N
scalp	N	C

I	N	N
then	N	N
placed	N	N
conditioner	N	C
on	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
and	N	N
lathered	N	C
it	N	N
all	N	N
over	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
washed	N	N
it	N	N
off	N	N
and	N	N
focused	N	C
on	N	N
washing	N	N
my	N	N
body	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
washing	N	N
my	N	N
body	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
rinsing	N	C
off	N	N
the	N	N
soap	N	N
suds	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
simply	C	N
let	N	N
the	N	N
hot	N	N
water	N	N
go	N	N
all	N	N
over	N	N
my	N	N
body	N	N
and	N	N
allowed	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
help	N	N
me	N	N
relax	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
needed	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
turned	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
cold	N	N
and	N	N
hot	N	N
taps	N	N
to	N	N
let	N	N
the	N	N
bathtub	N	C
fill	N	N
with	N	N
warm	N	N
water	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
a	N	N
towel	N	N
and	N	N
draped	N	C
it	N	N
over	N	N
the	N	N
curtain	N	C
rod	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
off	N	N
my	N	N
clothes	N	N
and	N	N
grabbed	N	N
my	N	N
favorite	N	N
rubber	N	C
ducky	N	C
from	N	N
a	N	N
shelf	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
dropped	N	N
him	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
.	N	N
	
If	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
did	N	N
he	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
also	N	N
poured	N	C
some	N	N
bubble	C	C
bath	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
as	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
filling	N	C
with	N	N
water	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
foamed	N	C
up	N	N
into	N	N
lots	N	N
of	N	N
bubbles	N	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
was	N	N
full	N	N
enough	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
turned	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
,	N	N
being	N	N
careful	N	N
not	N	N
to	N	N
slip	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
slippery	C	C
porcelain	N	C

I	N	N
lay	N	N

water	N	N
and	N	N
shut	N	N
my	N	N

When	N	N

I	N	N
stood	N	N

I	N	N
draped	N	C
it	N	N
around	N	N
myself	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
opened	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
's	N	N
drain	C	C
so	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
could	N	N
drain	C	C
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
off	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
dressed	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
done	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bathroom	N	N
and	N	N
turned	N	N
the	N	N
shower	N	N
on	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
minute	N	N
so	N	N
the	N	N
bubbles	N	C
would	N	N
all	N	N
go	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
drain	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
picked	N	N
up	N	N
my	N	N
rubber	N	C
ducky	N	C
and	N	N
gave	N	N
him	N	N
a	N	N
squeeze	C	C
until	N	N
he	N	N
quacked	N	C

Then	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
him	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
shelf	N	C
until	N	N
next	N	N
time	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
a	N	N
long	N	N
day	N	N
of	N	N
work	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
on	N	N
some	N	N
good	N	N
relaxing	N	C
acoustic	N	C
music	N	N
to	N	N
listen	N	N
to	N	N
while	N	N
I	N	N

Then	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
the	N	N

and	N	N
hot	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
stopped	N	N
the	N	N
drain	C	C

After	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
was	N	N

I	N	N
added	N	N
lavender	N	C
bubbles	N	C

I	N	N
got	N	N
a	N	N
tray	C	C

place	N	N
across	N	N
the	N	N
bath	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
wine	N	N
and	N	N
a	N	N
magazine	N	N
and	N	N
some	N	N
chocolate	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
sank	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
sighed	N	C
with	N	N
relief	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
drank	N	N
three	N	N
glasses	N	N
of	N	N
wine	N	N
and	N	N
haphazardly	N	C
paged	N	C
through	N	N
the	N	N
magazine	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
done	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
bath	N	N
I	N	N
pulled	N	N
the	N	N
plug	N	C
and	N	N
drained	N	C
the	N	N
water	N	N

Then	N	N
I	N	N
turned	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
shower	N	N
to	N	N
rinse	N	C
myself	N	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
soap	N	C
was	N	N
off	N	N
I	N	N
stepped	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
dried	N	N
off	N	N

then	N	N
put	N	N

my	N	N
robe	N	C

I	N	N
was	N	N
now	N	N

and	N	N
was	N	N
ready	N	N
for	N	N

For	N	N
me	N	N
there	N	N
is	N	N
nothing	N	N
more	N	N
relaxing	N	C
then	N	N
taking	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
hot	N	N
bath	N	N
after	N	N
a	N	N
long	N	N
day	N	N
of	N	N
work	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
home	N	N
the	N	N
first	N	N
thing	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
was	N	N
start	N	N
the	N	N
running	N	N
water	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
temperature	N	C
was	N	N
perfect	N	N
before	N	N
putting	N	N
the	N	N
drain	C	C
stopper	N	C
in	N	N
place	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N

room	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
some	N	N
clean	N	N
clothes	N	N
and	N	N
a	N	N
towel	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
closet	N	C

I	N	N
like	N	N
to	N	N
listen	N	N
to	N	N
music	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N

I	N	N
brought	N	N

When	N	N

turned	N	N

,	N	N
and	N	N
stepped	N	N
inside	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
like	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
piece	N	N
of	N	N
heaven	C	N
as	N	N
the	N	N
warm	N	N
water	N	N
washed	N	C
over	N	N
my	N	N
body	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
about	N	N
10	N	N
minutes	N	N

I	N	N
found	C	N

it	N	N
all	N	N
over	N	N
my	N	N

After	N	N

then	N	N
I	N	N
finally	N	N
slipped	N	C

It	N	N
was	N	N

Last	N	N

I	N	N

the	N	N
faucet	N	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
some	N	N
hot	N	N

After	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N

then	N	N
plug	N	C
the	N	N

put	N	N
them	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N

After	N	N
the	N	N

I	N	N

and	N	N
sit	N	N
down	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N

up	N	N
the	N	N

Today	N	N

Once	N	N

It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
bath	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
thought	N	N
about	N	N
taking	N	N
my	N	N
usual	N	N
shower	N	N
today	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
instead	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
have	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
stressful	N	C
week	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
relaxation	N	C
will	N	N
do	N	N
me	N	N
good	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
get	N	N
everything	N	N
ready	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
will	N	N
need-my	N	N
towel	N	N
,	N	N
my	N	N
bath	N	N
beads	N	C
,	N	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
and	N	N
a	N	N
candle	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
run	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
just	N	N
a	N	N
bit	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
warm	N	N
side	N	N
since	N	N
I	N	N
do	N	N
n't	N	N
want	N	N
the	N	N
bath	N	N
getting	N	N
cold	N	N
too	N	N
soon	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
stopper	N	C
in	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bath	N	N
drain	C	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
pour	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
bath	N	N
beads	N	C
.	N	N
	
Time	N	N
to	N	N
run	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
've	N	N
lit	N	N
my	N	N
candle	N	N
and	N	N
grabbed	N	N
my	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
love	N	N
to	N	N
soak	C	C
for	N	N
a	N	N
bit	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
's	N	N
so	N	N
relaxing	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
will	N	N
get	N	N
through	N	N
a	N	N
chapter	N	C
or	N	N
two	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
book	N	N
,	N	N
depending	N	C
how	N	N
fast	N	N
I	N	N
feel	N	N
like	N	N
reading	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
whole	N	N
atmosphere	N	C
is	N	N
de-stressing	N	C
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
my	N	N
bath	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
will	N	N
towel	N	C
off	N	N
and	N	N
get	N	N
into	N	N
my	N	N
pajamas	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
always	N	N
seem	N	N
to	N	N
sleep	N	N
better	N	N
after	N	N
taking	N	N
a	N	N
relaxing	N	C
bath	N	N
.	N	N
	
As	N	N
a	N	N
child	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
loved	N	N
taking	N	N
baths	N	C
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
mother	N	N
always	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
fill	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
for	N	N
me	N	N
so	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
would	N	N
not	N	N
be	N	N
too	N	N
hot	N	N
or	N	N
too	N	N
cold	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
'd	N	N
say	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
ideal	C	C
temperature	N	C
for	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
was	N	N
about	N	N
90	N	N
degrees	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
favorite	N	N
part	N	N
of	N	N
taking	N	N
a	N	N
bath	N	N
was	N	N
the	N	N
bubbles	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
loved	N	N
to	N	N
splash	C	C
around	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
and	N	N
play	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
bubbles	N	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
sat	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
used	N	N
shampoo	N	C
to	N	N
wash	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
and	N	N
a	N	N
washed	N	N
my	N	N
body	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
soapy	N	C
washcloth	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
wash	N	N
behind	N	N
my	N	N
ears	N	N
and	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
face	N	N
as	N	N
well	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
clean	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
play	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
bath	N	N
toys	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
while	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
some	N	N
time	N	N
has	N	N
passed	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
drained	N	C
the	N	N
water	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
draining	N	C
the	N	N
water	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
stand	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
dry	N	N
myself	N	N
off	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
towel	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
enjoyed	N	C
taking	N	N
baths	N	C
because	N	N
I	N	N
often	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
cleaned	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
loved	N	N
to	N	N
play	N	N
outside	N	N
as	N	N
a	N	N
kid	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
ride	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
to	N	N
work	N	N
everyday	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
also	N	N
ride	N	N
for	N	N
pleasure	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
weekends	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
morning	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
pedaling	N	C
along	N	N
and	N	N
all	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
sudden	C	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
feel	N	N
the	N	N
gritty	N	C
pavement	N	C
scraping	N	C
the	N	N
rim	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
and	N	N
sure	N	N
enough	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
tire	C	C
was	N	N
flat	N	N
.	N	N
	
Well	N	N
that	N	N
is	N	N
bad	N	N
but	N	N
not	N	N
as	N	N
bad	N	N
if	N	N
the	N	N
rear	C	N
tire	C	N
was	N	N
flat	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
chain	N	C
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
always	N	N
carry	N	N
a	N	N
spare	N	C
inner	C	C
tube	N	C
and	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
pump	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
frame	N	C
of	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
was	N	N
going	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
easy	N	N
as	N	N
I	N	N
have	N	N
done	N	N
this	N	N
many	N	N
times	C	N
before	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
loosened	N	C
the	N	N
lock	N	N
nuts	N	C
that	N	N
hold	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
tire	C	N
in	N	N
place	N	N
and	N	N
pulled	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
from	N	N
the	N	N
frame	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
looked	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
pack	N	N
and	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
tool	C	N
that	N	N
helps	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
off	N	N
the	N	N
rim	N	C
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
took	N	N
all	N	N
of	N	N
5	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
that	N	N
off	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
old	N	N
inner	C	C
tube	N	N
and	N	N
placed	N	N
it	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
backpack	N	C
to	N	N
patch	C	C
later	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
fit	N	C
the	N	N
good	N	N
inner	C	C
tube	N	C
inside	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
and	N	N
in	N	N
reverse	C	C
order	N	N
fitted	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
rim	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
next	N	N
took	N	N
my	N	N
pump	N	N
and	N	N
filled	N	N
it	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
correct	N	N
pressure	C	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
back	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
fork	N	C
and	N	N
tightened	N	C
the	N	N
locking	N	C
nuts	N	C
and	N	N
was	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
way	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
even	N	N
late	N	N
for	N	N
work	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
other	N	N
day	N	N
,	N	N
my	N	N
best	N	N
friend	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
were	N	N
riding	N	N
to	N	N
his	N	N
house	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
we	N	N
were	N	N
almost	N	N
there	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
noticed	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
tire	C	C
on	N	N
my	N	N
bicycle	N	N
felt	N	N
rather	N	N
wobbly	N	C
and	N	N
was	N	N
most	N	N
likely	N	N
flat	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
in	N	N
luck	N	N
however	N	N
,	N	N
as	N	N
my	N	N
friend	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
bicycle	N	N
repair	N	C
kit	N	N
and	N	N
some	N	N
spare	N	C
tires	N	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
we	N	N
arrived	N	N
at	N	N
my	N	N
friend	N	N
's	N	N
house	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
asked	N	N
my	N	N
friend	N	N
if	N	N
he	N	N
let	N	N
me	N	N
borrow	N	C
his	N	N
bicycle	N	N
repair	N	C
kit	N	N
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
turned	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
over	N	N
and	N	N
removed	N	C
the	N	N
front	N	N
tire	C	C
and	N	N
tube	N	C
.	N	N
	
Next	N	N
I	N	N
filled	N	N
the	N	N
tube	N	N
with	N	N
air	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
where	N	N
the	N	N
tube	N	N
was	N	N
damaged	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
small	N	N
glass	N	N
shard	N	C
which	N	N
had	N	N
punctured	N	C
through	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
making	N	N
ensure	C	C
the	N	N
tube	N	N
was	N	N
fully	N	N
deflated	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
repaired	N	C
the	N	N
puncture	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
tube	N	N
by	N	N
using	N	N
glue	C	C
and	N	N
applying	N	N
a	N	N
patch	C	C
on	N	N
top	N	N
,	N	N
then	N	N
slid	N	C
it	N	N
back	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
using	N	N
my	N	N
hands	N	N
.	N	N
	
Next	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
placed	N	C
and	N	N
pushed	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
back	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N
tube	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
which	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
reconnected	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	C
onto	N	N
the	N	N
bicycle	N	N
.	N	N
	
Finally	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
pumped	N	C
air	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
until	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
filled	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
bicycle	N	N
was	N	N
ready	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
ridden	N	C
again	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
bike	N	N
tire	C	C
was	N	N
flat	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
shop	N	N
and	N	N
bought	N	N
a	N	N
replacement	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
first	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
old	N	N
tire	C	C
off	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
set	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
rack	N	C
to	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
flat	N	N
tire	C	N
would	N	N
be	N	N
easy	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
to	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
new	N	N
tire	C	C
around	N	N
the	N	N
wheel	N	N
to	N	N
see	N	N
if	N	N
it	N	N
fits	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
did	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
new	N	N
tire	C	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
grooves	N	C
inside	N	N
the	N	N
wheel	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
walked	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
gas	N	N
station	N	N
just	N	N
around	N	N
the	N	N
corner	N	N
to	N	N
fill	N	N
it	N	N
up	N	N
with	N	N
air	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
quarter	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
air	N	N
machine	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
next	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
air	N	N
hose	N	C
and	N	N
filled	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	N
up	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
checked	N	N
the	N	N
air	N	N
pressure	C	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
gauge	N	C
and	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
alright	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
felt	N	N
around	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
that	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
solidly	N	C
in	N	N
place	N	N
and	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
.	N	N
	
While	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
out	N	N
riding	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
one	N	N
warm	N	N
spring	N	N
day	N	N
,	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tires	N	C
went	N	N
flat	N	N
.	N	N
	
Fortunately	N	C
I	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
repair	N	C
kit	N	N
with	N	N
me	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
pouch	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
always	N	N
kept	N	N
it	N	N
with	N	N
me	N	N
on	N	N
rides	N	N
just	N	N
in	N	N
case	N	N
of	N	N
such	C	N
an	N	N
occurrence	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
side	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
trail	C	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
way	N	N
of	N	N
other	N	N
bikers	N	C
and	N	N
runners	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
lay	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
on	N	N
its	N	N
side	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
the	N	N
repair	N	C
kit	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
pouch	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
repair	N	C
kit	N	N
contained	N	C
a	N	N
new	N	N
inner	C	C
tube	N	N
which	N	N
I	N	N
inflated	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
pulled	N	N
the	N	N
outer	C	C
tire	C	C
off	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
inner	C	N
tube	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
replaced	N	N
the	N	N
flattened	N	C
inner	C	N
tube	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
new	N	N
one	N	N
and	N	N
replaced	N	C
the	N	N
outer	C	N
tire	C	N
over	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
rode	N	N
off	N	N
slowly	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
everything	N	N
was	N	N
correctly	N	C
in	N	N
place	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
home	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
replaced	N	C
the	N	N
spare	N	C
tire	C	C
kit	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
new	N	N
one	N	N
so	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
be	N	N
prepared	N	C
on	N	N
my	N	N
next	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
going	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
bike	N	N
ride	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
friend	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
pulled	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
garage	N	C
only	N	N
to	N	N
discover	N	C
I	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
flat	N	N
tire	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
sure	N	N
if	N	N
the	N	N
flat	N	N
was	N	N
just	N	N
from	N	N
a	N	N
slow	N	N
leak	C	C
or	N	N
a	N	N
bad	N	N
tube	N	C
.	N	N
	
If	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
from	N	N
a	N	N
bad	N	N
tube	N	C
I	N	N
would	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
use	N	N
tools	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
completely	N	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
replace	N	C
the	N	N
tube	N	C
.	N	N
	
If	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
just	N	N
a	N	N
slow	N	N
leak	C	C
I	N	N
could	N	N
just	N	N
inflate	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
air	N	N
pump	N	N
and	N	N
be	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
way	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
try	N	N
the	N	N
easy	N	N
route	N	N
first	N	N
and	N	N
inflated	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
pump	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
felt	N	N
as	N	N
if	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
was	N	N
full	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
problem	N	N
was	N	N
solved	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
test	N	N
ride	N	N
around	N	N
the	N	N
neighborhood	N	C
just	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
sure	N	N
that	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
fully	N	N
inflated	N	C
and	N	N
would	N	N
stay	N	N
that	N	N
way	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
stayed	N	N
inflated	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
set	N	N
off	N	N
to	N	N
meet	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
friend	N	N
.	N	N
	
If	N	N
you	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
flat	N	N
tire	C	N
it	N	N
is	N	N
quite	N	N
easy	N	N
to	N	N
change	N	N
it	N	N
yourself	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
front	N	N
tire	C	N
is	N	N
the	N	N
easiest	N	C
to	N	N
change	N	N
while	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
will	N	N
require	N	N
more	N	N
time	N	N
and	N	N
maybe	N	N
additional	C	C
tools	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
is	N	N
usually	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
tire	C	N
is	N	N
where	N	N
the	N	N
chain	N	C
and	N	N
gears	N	C
are	N	N
connected	N	N
to	N	N
so	N	N
it	N	N
is	N	N
harder	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
frame	N	C
.	N	N
	
Sadly	C	C
,	N	N
most	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
time	N	N
a	N	N
flat	N	N
tire	C	N
is	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
tire	C	N
because	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
tire	C	N
supports	N	C
most	N	N
of	N	N
your	N	N
weight	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
bicycle	N	N
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
you	N	N
'll	N	N
need	N	N
a	N	N
wrench	N	C
to	N	N
undo	C	C
the	N	N
bolts	N	C
on	N	N
both	N	N
sides	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
will	N	N
allow	N	N
you	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
entire	C	N
tire	C	N
.	N	N
	
Inside	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
is	N	N
an	N	N
innertube	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
this	N	N
is	N	N
the	N	N
part	N	N
you	N	N
either	N	N
need	N	N
to	N	N
replace	N	C
or	N	N
patch	C	C
up	N	N
.	N	N
	
If	N	N
it	N	N
is	N	N
a	N	N
small	N	N
hole	N	N
and	N	N
you	N	N
can	N	N
easily	N	N
find	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
,	N	N
you	N	N
can	N	N
use	N	N
a	N	N
tire	C	N
patch	C	C
kit	N	N
to	N	N
fix	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
Other	N	N
wise	C	N
you	N	N
may	N	N
just	N	N
replace	N	N
the	N	N
entire	C	N
innertube	N	C
altogether	N	C
.	N	N
	
Either	N	N
way	N	N
you	N	N
will	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
innertube	N	C
back	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
back	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
frame	N	C
.	N	N
	
Lastly	C	N
,	N	N
screw	N	C
back	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bolts	N	C
and	N	N
pump	N	C
some	N	N
air	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
.	N	N
	
You	N	N
'll	N	N
be	N	N
ready	N	N
to	N	N
ride	N	N
soon	N	N
after	N	N
!	N	N
One	N	N
day	N	N
my	N	N
bicycle	N	N
tire	C	N
got	N	N
flat	N	N
due	N	N
to	N	N
hitting	N	N
some	N	N
glass	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
street	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
walk	N	N
the	N	N
rest	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
way	N	N
home	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
it	N	N
into	N	N
my	N	N
garage	N	C
and	N	N
tried	N	N
to	N	N
repair	N	C
it	N	N
by	N	N
putting	N	N
some	N	N
duct	N	C
tape	N	N
on	N	N
it	N	N
and	N	N
pumping	N	C
it	N	N
with	N	N
air	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
,	N	N
however	N	N
,	N	N
only	N	N
made	N	N
matters	N	N
worst	N	N
and	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
air	N	N
ended	N	N
up	N	N
making	N	N
another	N	N
hole	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
tire	C	N
because	N	N
I	N	N
over	N	N
inflated	N	C
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
no	N	N
other	N	N
options	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
ordered	N	N
a	N	N
new	N	N
tire	C	C
on	N	N
Amazon	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
that	N	N
came	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
mail	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
time	N	N
to	N	N
repair	N	C
my	N	N
broken	N	N
bike	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
a	N	N
socket	N	C
wrench	N	C
and	N	N
unscrewed	N	C
the	N	N
nut	C	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
that	N	N
attached	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
wheel	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
my	N	N
new	N	N
bike	N	N
tire	C	C
and	N	N
put	N	N
it	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
frame	N	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
and	N	N
screwed	N	C
it	N	N
back	N	N
on	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
that	N	N
was	N	N
complete	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
was	N	N
as	N	N
good	N	N
as	N	N
new	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
riding	N	N
my	N	N
daily	N	C
bike	N	N
trail	C	C
by	N	N
my	N	N
house	N	N
.	N	N
	
my	N	N
sister	N	N
Jane	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
love	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
bicycling	N	C
.	N	N
	
One	N	N
warm	N	N
day	N	N
in	N	N
June	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
out	N	N
and	N	N
ride	N	N
but	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
flat	N	N
tire	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
carefully	N	C
took	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
off	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
rim	N	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
inflated	N	C
it	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
hand	N	N
pump	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
find	N	N
the	N	N
leak	C	C
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
blast	N	C
of	N	N
cool	N	N
air	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
fingers	N	N
led	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
problem	N	N
:	N	N
a	N	N
single	N	N
round	N	N
hole	N	N
,	N	N
probably	N	N
caused	N	N
by	N	N
a	N	N
nail	C	C
or	N	N
other	N	N
sharp	N	N
object	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
out	N	N
my	N	N
patch	C	C
kit	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
Jane	N	N
held	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
for	N	N
me	N	N
as	N	N
I	N	N
first	N	N
applied	N	C
glue	C	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
placed	N	N
a	N	N
patch	C	C
carefully	N	N
over	N	N
the	N	N
damaged	N	C
area	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
let	N	N
it	N	N
dry	N	C
,	N	N
so	N	N
we	N	N
took	N	N
turns	N	N
riding	N	N
Jane	N	N
's	N	N
bike	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
while	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
inflated	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	N
and	N	N
checked	N	N
the	N	N
patch	C	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
good	N	N
!	N	N
The	N	N
leak	C	C
was	N	N
repaired	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
back	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
and	N	N
we	N	N
went	N	N
off	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
long	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
happy	N	N
to	N	N
have	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
fixed	C	N
again	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
about	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
bicycle	N	C
ride	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
garage	N	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
I	N	N
realized	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
was	N	N
completely	N	N
flat	N	N
.	N	N
	
Luckily	N	C
I	N	N
was	N	N
prepared	N	C
for	N	N
just	N	N
such	C	N
an	N	N
event	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
shelf	N	C
and	N	N
found	C	N
my	N	N
bicycle	N	N
repair	N	C
kit	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
close	N	N
look	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
bicycle	N	N
tire	C	C
.	N	N
	
If	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
n't	N	N
find	N	N
the	N	N
leak	C	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
always	N	N
fill	N	N
a	N	N
tub	N	C
with	N	N
water	N	N
,	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
under	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
see	N	N
where	N	N
the	N	N
bubbles	N	C
come	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
Luckily	N	C
the	N	N
leak	C	C
was	N	N
obvious	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
applied	N	N
some	N	N
adhesive	N	C
from	N	N
the	N	N
kit	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
rubber	N	C
patch	C	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
down	N	N
my	N	N
bicycle	N	C
pump	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
hooked	N	C
the	N	N
hose	N	C
up	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
nipple	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
pumped	N	C
up	N	N
and	N	N
down	N	N
vigorously	N	C
for	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
felt	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
nice	N	N
and	N	N
firm	N	N
.	N	N
	
Success	N	C
!	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
away	N	N
the	N	N
pump	N	N
and	N	N
kit	N	N
and	N	N
hopped	N	C
on	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
,	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
12	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
flat	N	N
bicycle	N	N
tire	C	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
ridden	N	C
over	N	N
a	N	N
nail	C	C
and	N	N
my	N	N
tire	C	N
was	N	N
punctured	N	C
and	N	N
my	N	N
tube	N	C
popped	N	C
.	N	N
	
In	N	N
order	N	N
to	N	N
fix	N	N
it	N	N
my	N	N
brother	N	N
took	N	N
me	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
buy	N	N
a	N	N
patch	C	C
to	N	N
fix	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
we	N	N
got	N	N
the	N	N
patch	C	C
,	N	N
we	N	N
went	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
house	N	N
.	N	N
	
In	N	N
order	N	N
to	N	N
find	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
we	N	N
filled	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	C
with	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
tube	N	C
in	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
looked	N	N
to	N	N
see	N	N
where	N	N
bubbles	N	C
came	N	N
out	N	N
;	N	N
where	N	N
the	N	N
bubbles	N	C
came	N	N
out	N	N
told	N	N
us	N	N
where	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
was	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
we	N	N
noted	N	C
the	N	N
location	N	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
we	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
tube	N	C
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tub	N	N
and	N	N
dried	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
To	N	N
put	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
patch	C	C
we	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
glue	C	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
tube	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
put	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
patch	C	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
held	N	N
it	N	N
there	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
minutes	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
it	N	N
would	N	N
stay	N	N
,	N	N
then	N	N
we	N	N
let	N	N
it	N	N
sit	N	N
for	N	N
an	N	N
hour	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
glue	C	C
would	N	N
dry	N	N
.	N	N
	
To	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
it	N	N
dried	N	C
well	N	N
we	N	N
placed	N	N
the	N	N
tube	N	C
out	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
sun	N	N
so	N	N
the	N	N
the	N	N
heat	N	N
could	N	N
help	N	N
it	N	N
along	N	N
.	N	N
	
To	N	N
be	N	N
safe	N	N
we	N	N
waited	N	N
a	N	N
day	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
next	N	N
day	N	N
we	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
tube	N	C
and	N	N
put	N	N
it	N	N
back	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
,	N	N
then	N	N
we	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
wheel	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
bike	N	N
was	N	N
good	N	N
to	N	N
ride	N	N
again	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
riding	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
lane	C	C
going	N	N
to	N	N
work	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
felt	N	N
my	N	N
tire	C	C
pop	N	N
and	N	N
give	N	N
out	N	N
on	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
quickly	N	N
pulled	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
side	N	N
walk	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
look	N	N
at	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
rock	N	N
was	N	N
embedded	N	C
into	N	N
my	N	N
tire	C	N
tube	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
pried	N	C
the	N	N
rock	N	N
out	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
fingers	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
my	N	N
patch	C	C
kit	N	N
from	N	N
my	N	N
backpack	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
there	N	N
was	N	N
no	N	N
other	N	N
debris	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
applied	N	N
the	N	N
glue	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
stuck	C	N
the	N	N
patch	C	C
onto	N	N
the	N	N
glue	C	C
and	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
fit	N	C
and	N	N
held	N	N
well	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
that	N	N
i	N	N
pumped	N	C
my	N	N
tire	C	N
back	N	N
up	N	N
with	N	N
air	N	N
and	N	N
checked	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
it	N	N
would	N	N
hold	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
rigors	N	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
road	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
hopped	N	C
back	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
and	N	N
slowly	N	N
rode	N	N
to	N	N
work	N	N
careful	N	C
of	N	N
anymore	N	N
rocks	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
to	N	N
work	N	N
on	N	N
time	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
is	N	N
why	N	N
i	N	N
always	N	N
carry	N	N
around	N	N
my	N	N
repair	N	C
kit	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
other	N	N
day	N	N
my	N	N
dad	N	N
was	N	N
riding	N	N
his	N	N
bike	N	N
and	N	N
started	N	N
having	N	N
trouble	N	N
steering	N	C
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
rode	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
back	N	N
home	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
took	N	N
it	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
yard	N	N
to	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
look	N	N
at	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
noticed	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
tire	C	C
was	N	N
flat	N	N
and	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
keeping	N	N
air	N	N
in	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
took	N	N
it	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
he	N	N
pumped	N	C
it	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
tried	N	N
to	N	N
see	N	N
if	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
would	N	N
hold	N	N
air	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
would	N	N
not	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
he	N	N
rubbed	N	C
liquid	N	C
dish	N	N
detergent	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
and	N	N
pumped	N	C
it	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
looked	N	N
for	N	N
where	N	N
it	N	N
bubbled	N	C
to	N	N
see	N	N
where	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
was	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
he	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
,	N	N
he	N	N
decided	N	N
if	N	N
it	N	N
needed	N	N
a	N	N
patch	C	C
or	N	N
a	N	N
plug	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
small	N	N
round	N	N
hole	N	N
so	N	N
he	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
plug	N	C
in	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
got	N	N
the	N	N
packages	N	C
of	N	N
plugs	N	C
and	N	N
found	C	N
one	N	N
that	N	N
was	N	N
the	N	N
right	N	N
size	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
followed	N	N
the	N	N
instructs	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
package	C	C
to	N	N
insert	C	C
the	N	N
plug	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
and	N	N
secure	C	C
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
pumped	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	C
back	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
it	N	N
held	N	N
air	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
back	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
husband	N	N
was	N	N
riding	N	N
down	N	N
a	N	N
steep	N	C
hill	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
miles	C	N
from	N	N
home	N	N
when	N	N
he	N	N
got	N	N
a	N	N
blow	N	C
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
called	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
come	N	N
and	N	N
get	N	N
him	N	N
.	N	N
	
Luckily	N	C
he	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
hurt	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
had	N	N
the	N	N
bicycle	N	N
repair	N	C
kit	N	N
on	N	N
him	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
off	N	N
with	N	N
some	N	N
tools	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
inner	C	C
tube	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
checked	N	N
the	N	N
inner	C	C
tube	N	N
for	N	N
holes	N	N
by	N	N
putting	N	N
air	N	N
in	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
and	N	N
marked	N	C
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
That	N	N
is	N	N
the	N	N
place	N	N
where	N	N
he	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
patch	C	C
and	N	N
glued	N	C
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
husband	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
tube	N	C
back	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
bicycle	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
frame	N	C
was	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
bent	N	C
but	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
was	N	N
okay	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
followed	N	N
him	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
while	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
was	N	N
almost	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
park	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
met	N	N
him	N	N
there	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
a	N	N
while	N	N
we	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
truck	N	N
and	N	N
drove	N	N
home	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
out	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
garage	N	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
saw	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
I	N	N
realized	N	N
that	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tires	N	C
were	N	N
flat	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
buy	N	N
a	N	N
new	N	N
tube	N	C
in	N	N
order	N	N
to	N	N
fix	N	N
the	N	N
flat	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
drove	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
local	N	N
bike	N	N
shop	N	N
and	N	N
purchased	N	C
a	N	N
tube	N	C
that	N	N
would	N	N
fit	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
's	N	N
tire	C	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
I	N	N
drove	N	N
back	N	N
home	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
tube	N	C
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
packaging	N	C
and	N	N
read	N	N
the	N	N
instructions	N	C
on	N	N
how	N	N
to	N	N
put	N	N
it	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
removed	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	C
from	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
and	N	N
took	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
old	N	N
tube	N	N
that	N	N
was	N	N
punctured	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
inserted	N	C
the	N	N
new	N	N
tube	N	C
onto	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
back	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
and	N	N
pumped	N	C
up	N	N
the	N	N
tube	N	C
with	N	N
air	N	N
until	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
filled	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
desired	N	C
fill	N	N
weight	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
to	N	N
test	N	N
it	N	N
and	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
in	N	N
great	N	N
shape	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
off	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
Yesterday	N	N
,	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
tire	C	C
popped	N	C
while	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
riding	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
walk	N	N
45	N	N
min	N	N
home	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
it	N	N
fixed	C	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
tried	N	N
riding	N	N
it	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
flat	N	N
tire	C	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
dragged	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
cement	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
n't	N	N
have	N	N
the	N	N
man	N	N
power	N	N
to	N	N
turn	N	N
the	N	N
wheels	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
home	N	N
I	N	N
asked	N	N
my	N	N
father	N	N
for	N	N
help	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
inflated	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
mechanical	C	C
pump	N	N
.	N	N
	
You	N	N
grab	N	N
the	N	N
pump	N	N
with	N	N
two	N	N
hands	N	N
,	N	N
pull	N	N
the	N	N
lever	N	C
up	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
push	N	N
down	N	N
with	N	N
your	N	N
whole	N	N
body	N	N
weight	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
underwater	C	C
to	N	N
find	N	N
where	N	N
bubbles	N	C
were	N	N
coming	N	N
out	N	N
to	N	N
find	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
we	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
dried	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
and	N	N
sprayed	N	C
a	N	N

to	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
to	N	N
seal	C	C
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
Afterwards	N	C
,	N	N
we	N	N
inflated	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
see	N	N
if	N	N
it	N	N
worked	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
a	N	N
day	N	N
or	N	N
so	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
rode	N	N
it	N	N
again	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
was	N	N
n't	N	N
deflating	N	C
.	N	N
	
Yesterday	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
ride	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
because	N	N
the	N	N
weather	N	N
was	N	N
so	N	N
nice	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
storage	C	C
closet	N	C
and	N	N
noticed	N	N
it	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
flat	N	N
tire	C	N
.	N	N
	
Since	N	N
I	N	N
do	N	N
not	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
spare	N	C
tire	C	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
fix	N	N
it	N	N
if	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
found	C	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
pump	N	N
and	N	N
patch	C	C
kit	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
pumped	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	C
and	N	N
was	N	N
able	C	N
to	N	N
locate	C	C
the	N	N
air	N	N
leak	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
patch	C	C
and	N	N
applied	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
part	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
that	N	N
had	N	N
the	N	N
little	N	N
leak	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
pumped	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	C
again	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
careful	N	N
not	N	N
to	N	N
overfill	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	N
so	N	N
the	N	N
patch	C	C
would	N	N
n't	N	N
pop	N	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
patch	C	C
would	N	N
n't	N	N
come	N	N
off	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
pumped	N	C
the	N	N
air	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
sufficiently	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
tested	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	C
by	N	N
sitting	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
and	N	N
riding	N	N
around	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
tire	C	C
seemed	N	C
to	N	N
hold	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
ready	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
such	C	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
day	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
great	N	N
day	N	N
riding	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
.	N	N
	
Yesterday	N	N
while	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
riding	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
a	N	N
flat	N	N
tire	C	C
.	N	N
	
Luckily	N	C
I	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
tire	C	C
repair	N	C
kit	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
garage	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
's	N	N
very	N	N
easy	N	N
to	N	N
do	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
first	N	N
thing	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
was	N	N
use	N	N
a	N	N
flathead	N	C
screwdriver	N	C
to	N	N
pop	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	N
off	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
rim	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
tire	C	N
is	N	N
hollow	C	C
inside	N	N
,	N	N
with	N	N
no	N	N
tube	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
patch	C	C
kit	N	N
contains	N	N
small	N	N
rubber	N	C
patches	N	C
with	N	N
glue	C	C
,	N	N
that	N	N
you	N	N
use	N	N
to	N	N
seal	C	C
up	N	N
any	N	N
holes	N	N
that	N	N
might	N	N
appear	N	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	C
off	N	N
the	N	N
rim	N	C
I	N	N
looked	N	N
all	N	N
around	N	N
inside	N	N
to	N	N
find	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
it	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
used	N	N
a	N	N
special	N	N
piece	N	N
of	N	N
sandpaper	N	C
inside	N	N
the	N	N
repair	N	C
kit	N	N
to	N	N
clean	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
area	N	N
around	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
the	N	N
glue	C	C
would	N	N
stick	N	N
nicely	C	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
applied	N	N
the	N	N
glue	C	C
and	N	N
put	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
small	N	N
rubber	N	C
patches	N	C
onto	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
instructions	N	C
said	N	N
to	N	N
let	N	N
it	N	N
dry	N	C
for	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
hours	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
inside	N	N
and	N	N
watched	N	N
TV	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
awhile	N	C
I	N	N
came	N	N
back	N	N
out	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
back	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
rim	N	C
,	N	N
then	N	N
used	N	N
a	N	N
pump	N	N
to	N	N
pump	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	N
full	N	N
of	N	N
air	N	N
.	N	N
	
Sure	N	N
enough	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
fixed	C	N
the	N	N
hole	N	C
!	N	N
Riding	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
through	N	N
the	N	N
park	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
enjoying	N	C
the	N	N
beautiful	N	N
spring	N	N
scenery	N	C
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
family	N	N
of	N	N
squirrels	N	C
caught	N	N
my	N	N
attention	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
looking	N	N
at	N	N
them	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
hit	N	N
some	N	N
broken	N	N
glass	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
bike	N	N
's	N	N
tire	C	N
immediately	N	C
deflated	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
it	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
car	N	N
,	N	N
loaded	N	C
up	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
headed	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
local	N	N
department	N	C
store	N	N
.	N	N
	
Sure	N	N
enough	N	N
,	N	N
they	N	N
had	N	N
bike	N	N
tire	C	C
repair	N	C
kits	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
sporting	N	C
goods	N	N
section	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
bought	N	N
one	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
headed	N	C
on	N	N
home	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
there	N	N
I	N	N
removed	N	C
a	N	N
wheel	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
.	N	N
	
From	N	N
it	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
inner	C	C
tube	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
rubbed	N	C
some	N	N
soapy	N	C
water	N	N
on	N	N
it	N	N
and	N	N
quickly	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
problem	N	N
spot	N	N
.	N	N
	
From	N	N
my	N	N
new	N	N
repair	N	C
kit	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
special	N	N
patch	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
applied	N	C
the	N	N
sealant	N	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
stuck	C	C
the	N	N
patch	C	C
on	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
used	N	N
a	N	N
hair	N	N
dryer	N	C
to	N	N
heat	N	N
and	N	N
set	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
Next	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
air	N	N
compressor	N	C
and	N	N
reinflated	N	C
the	N	N
inner	C	N
tube	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
reassembling	N	C
everything	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
sat	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bike	N	N
and	N	N
tested	N	C
it	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
Good	N	N
as	N	N
new	N	N
!	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
bike	N	N
ride	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
out	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
garage	N	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
brought	N	N
it	N	N
out	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
driveway	N	C
and	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
noticed	N	N
that	N	N
something	N	N
did	N	N
n't	N	N
feel	N	N
right	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
too	N	N
hard	N	N
to	N	N
pedal	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
looked	N	N
down	N	N
and	N	N
noticed	N	N
that	N	N
my	N	N
front	N	N
tire	C	C
was	N	N
flat	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
back	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
garage	N	C
and	N	N
brought	N	N
out	N	N
my	N	N
bicycle	N	N
pump	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
removed	N	C
the	N	N
cover	N	C
from	N	N
the	N	N
air	N	N
valve	N	C
and	N	N
attached	N	C
the	N	N
pump	N	N
to	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
pumped	N	C
up	N	N
and	N	N
down	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
handle	N	C
a	N	N
few	N	N
times	C	N
and	N	N
noticed	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
air	N	N
was	N	N
not	N	N
staying	N	N
in	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
back	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N

and	N	N
this	N	N

and	N	N
then	N	N
filled	N	N
the	N	N
tire	C	N
with	N	N
air	N	N

The	N	N
patch	C	C
seemed	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
nice	N	N
and	N	N
sturdy	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
believed	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
going	N	N
to	N	N

I	N	N
put	N	N

punctured	N	C
the	N	N

I	N	N

the	N	N
man	N	N
behind	N	N
the	N	N

asked	N	N
what	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
help	N	N
with	N	N

I	N	N
explained	N	C
I	N	N
needed	N	N
a	N	N
new	N	N
inner	C	C
tube	N	C
for	N	N
my	N	N
bike	N	N
since	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
gotten	N	N
a	N	N
flat	N	N
tire	C	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
showed	N	N
him	N	N
the	N	N
model	N	C
number	N	N

I	N	N
payed	N	C

thank	N	N
the	N	N

and	N	N
went	N	N
home	N	N
to	N	N
fix	N	N
my	N	N

I	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
tire	C	C
off	N	N
and	N	N
gently	C	C
pried	N	C
the	N	N
outer	C	C
tire	C	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
inner	C	N
tube	N	N
is	N	N
sort	N	N
of	N	N
pliable	N	C
so	N	N
I	N	N
stretched	N	C
it	N	N
over	N	N
and	N	N
off	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
rim	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
new	N	N
inner	C	C
tube	N	C
and	N	N
stretched	N	C
it	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
metal	N	N
rim	N	C

making	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
stem	N	C
when	N	N
you	N	N
inflate	N	C

tire	C	N
was	N	N
lined	N	N
up	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
metal	N	N
rim	N	C

I	N	N
replaced	N	C
the	N	N

re-inflated	N	C
the	N	N
tire	C	N
with	N	N
my	N	N

Now	N	N
I	N	N
can	N	N
ride	N	N
my	N	N

''	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
shopping	N	N
downtown	N	C

so	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
public	N	N
bus	N	N

I	N	N
waited	N	N

The	N	N

Then	N	N

got	N	N
on	N	N

When	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
my	N	N
turn	N	N
I	N	N
stepped	N	C
up	N	N
the	N	N
few	N	N
steps	N	N
into	N	N
front	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N

chose	N	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
crowded	N	C
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
stood	N	N
and	N	N
held	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N
bar	N	N
.	N	N
	
An	N	N
elderly	N	C
woman	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
next	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
a	N	N
younger	N	N
person	N	N
got	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
give	N	N
her	N	N
his	N	N
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
everyone	N	N
was	N	N
on	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
put	N	N
on	N	N
his	N	N
turn	N	N
signal	C	C
and	N	N
pulled	N	N
back	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
street	N	N
.	N	N
	
As	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
closer	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
stop	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
pulled	N	N
the	N	N
cord	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
cord	N	C
dinged	N	C
to	N	N
signal	C	C
that	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
pulled	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
stop	N	N
where	N	N
other	N	N
people	N	N
were	N	N
waiting	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
on	N	N
.	N	N
	
They	N	N
waited	N	N
until	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
before	N	N
boarding	N	C
.	N	N
	
Last	N	N
Saturday	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
visit	N	N
a	N	N
friend	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
hospital	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
own	N	N
a	N	N
car	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
it	N	N
's	N	N
been	N	N
acting	N	N
up	N	N
lately	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
set	N	N
out	N	N
from	N	N
my	N	N
apartment	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
spring	N	C
in	N	N
my	N	N
step	N	N
,	N	N
because	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
an	N	N
amazing	N	N
day	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
through	N	N
my	N	N
apartment	N	N
complex	C	C
's	N	N
parking	N	N
lot	N	N
to	N	N
reach	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
,	N	N
where	N	N
I	N	N
waited	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
around	N	N
5	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
it	N	N
came	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
stop	N	N
in	N	N
front	N	N
of	N	N
me	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
boarded	N	C
and	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
$	N	N
1	N	N
bill	N	N
and	N	N
2	N	N
quarters	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
fare	N	C
machine	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
selected	N	C
a	N	N
seat	N	N
near	N	N
the	N	N
entrance	N	C
,	N	N
because	N	N
it	N	N
has	N	N
more	N	N
space	N	N
and	N	N
fewer	N	N
people	N	N
.	N	N
	
Riding	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
often	N	N
gives	N	N
me	N	N
motion	C	N
sickness	C	C
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
closed	N	N
my	N	N
eyes	N	N
and	N	N
tried	N	N
to	N	N
ignore	C	C
the	N	N
swaying	N	C
motion	C	N
as	N	N
it	N	N
rolled	N	C
down	N	N
the	N	N
street	N	N
.	N	N
	
Behind	N	N
me	N	N
,	N	N
two	N	N
college	N	N
students	N	N
were	N	N
eagerly	C	C
discussing	N	C
a	N	N
class	N	N
project	N	N
.	N	N
	
In	N	N
the	N	N
very	N	N
back	N	N
,	N	N
a	N	N
small	N	N
child	N	N
was	N	N
loudly	N	C
pretending	N	C
to	N	N
be	N	N
a	N	N
dinosaur	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
glad	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
finally	N	N
reached	N	N
my	N	N
destination	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
pulled	N	N
the	N	N
cord	N	C
signaling	N	C
that	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
need	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
to	N	N
stop	N	N
next	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
hospital	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
exit	N	C
out	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
's	N	N
side	N	N
door	N	N
.	N	N
	
Fresh	N	N
air	N	N
never	N	N
smelled	N	C
so	N	N
good	N	N
!	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
craft	C	C
store	N	N
,	N	N
there	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
sale	C	N
!	N	N
Unfortunately	N	C
,	N	N
husband	N	N
had	N	N
the	N	N
car	N	N
and	N	N
he	N	N
would	N	N
be	N	N
gone	N	N
a	N	N
while	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
couple	N	N
dollars	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
fare	N	C
and	N	N
walked	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
waited	N	N
about	N	N
ten	N	N
minutes	N	N
,	N	N
then	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
came	N	N
around	N	N
the	N	N
corner	N	N
and	N	N
stopped	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
bench	C	C
I	N	N
was	N	N
sitting	N	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
few	N	N
people	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
stepped	N	C
through	N	N
the	N	N
doors	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
smiled	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
driver	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
money	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
machine	N	N
to	N	N
pay	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
at	N	N
an	N	N
open	N	N
place	N	N
and	N	N
looked	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
store	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
going	N	N
to	N	N
was	N	N
only	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
stops	N	N
away	N	N
and	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
saw	N	N
we	N	N
were	N	N
close	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
pulled	N	N
the	N	N
cord	N	C
to	N	N
signal	C	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
driver	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
ready	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
stopped	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
shopping	N	N
center	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
thanked	N	C
him	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
ride	N	N
as	N	N
I	N	N
stepped	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N
pavement	N	C

Yesterday	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
waited	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
others	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
arrived	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
scanned	N	C
my	N	N
bus	N	N
pass	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N

pass	N	N
scanner	N	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
took	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
was	N	N
not	N	N
crowded	N	C
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
able	C	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
near	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
sat	N	N
quietly	N	N
,	N	N
playing	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
cellphone	N	N
.	N	N
	
Others	N	N
stared	N	C
around	N	N
or	N	N
talked	N	N
quietly	N	N
amongst	C	N
themselves	N	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
bell	N	N
rang	N	C
every	N	N
few	N	N
blocks	N	N
to	N	N
indicate	C	C
someone	N	N
wanting	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
would	N	N
stop	N	N
,	N	N
let	N	N
people	N	N
off	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
let	N	N
new	N	N

The	N	N
bus	N	N
started	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
crowded	N	C
so	N	N
I	N	N
offered	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
to	N	N
an	N	N
older	N	N
woman	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
thanked	N	C
me	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
polite	N	C
etiquette	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
saw	N	N
my	N	N
stop	N	N
coming	N	N
up	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
pulled	N	N
the	N	N
lever	N	C
and	N	N
the	N	N
bell	N	N
rang	N	N
again	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
stopped	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
moments	N	N
later	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
thanked	N	C
the	N	N
bus	N	N
driver	N	N
for	N	N
his	N	N
services	N	N
and	N	N
exited	N	C
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
Today	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N

ride	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
home	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
market	N	N

I	N	N
walked	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
to	N	N
wait	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
next	N	N
bus	N	N

It	N	N
was	N	N
supposed	N	C
to	N	N
arrive	N	C
in	N	N
10	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
pulled	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
where	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
waiting	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
stood	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
walked	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
curb	C	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
driver	N	N
opened	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
doors	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
stepped	N	N
up	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
hand	N	N
my	N	N
money	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
driver	N	N
so	N	N
that	N	N

Once	N	N
the	N	N

took	N	N
my	N	N
money	N	N

I	N	N
walked	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
aisle	N	C
to	N	N
find	N	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
There	N	N
were	N	N
many	N	N
seats	N	N

so	N	N
I	N	N
picked	N	N
one	N	N
beside	N	N
an	N	N
older	N	N
lady	N	N
that	N	N
looked	N	N
like	N	N
my	N	N
grandmother	N	N

She	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
nice	N	N
and	N	N
talked	N	N
to	N	N
me	N	N
while	N	N
we	N	N
rode	N	C
down	N	N
the	N	N
street	N	N

Once	N	N

While	N	N

I	N	N
chatted	N	C
with	N	N
the	N	N
old	N	N
man	N	N

When	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
arrived	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
let	N	N
the	N	N
old	N	N
man	N	N
get	N	N

front	N	N
of	N	N

I	N	N

climbed	N	C
on	N	N
board	N	N
the	N	N

paid	N	N

and	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
driver	N	N
said	N	N
``	N	N
``	N	N
Good	N	N

``	N	N
as	N	N
he	N	N
handed	N	N
me	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	N
.	N	N
	
Holding	N	N
onto	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
near	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
stared	N	C
out	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
throughout	C	C
the	N	N
bus	N	N
journey	N	C
,	N	N
just	N	N
enjoying	N	C
the	N	N
view	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
my	N	N
stop	N	N
was	N	N
coming	N	N
up	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
pressed	N	N
the	N	N
button	N	N
to	N	N
let	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
driver	N	N
know	N	N
to	N	N
stop	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
stopped	N	N
at	N	N
my	N	N
stop	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
stood	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
,	N	N
thanking	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
driver	N	N
before	N	N
I	N	N
exited	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
to	N	N
San	N	N
Francisco	N	N
from	N	N
my	N	N
home	N	N
in	N	N
San	N	N
Jose	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
n't	N	N
feel	N	N
like	N	N
driving	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
looked	N	N
online	N	N
and	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
bus	N	N
route	N	C
from	N	N
here	N	N
to	N	N
there	N	N
that	N	N
was	N	N
leaving	N	N
in	N	N
just	N	N
about	N	N
30	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
house	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
empty	N	N
bus	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
stared	N	C
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
scenery	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
driver	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
nice	N	N
and	N	N
asked	N	N
me	N	N
how	N	N
my	N	N
day	N	N
was	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
spoke	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
whole	N	N
entire	C	N
ride	N	N
and	N	N
after	N	N
a	N	N
short	N	N
time	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
arrived	N	N
into	N	N
San	N	N
Francisco	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
pleasant	N	C
not	N	N
having	N	N
to	N	N
drive	N	N
and	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
smooth	N	C
ride	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
Luckily	N	C
,	N	N
there	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
much	N	N
traffic	N	C
so	N	N
we	N	N
got	N	N
there	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
short	N	N
time	N	N
frame	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
getting	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
driver	N	N
opened	N	N
his	N	N
doors	N	N
for	N	N
me	N	N
and	N	N
wished	N	C
me	N	N
a	N	N
great	N	N
day	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
did	N	N
the	N	N
same	N	N
and	N	N
stepped	N	N
off	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
it	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
easy	N	N
and	N	N
fun	N	N
experience	N	N
.	N	N
	
Yesterday	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
zoo	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
and	N	N
sat	N	N
down	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bench	C	N
while	N	N
I	N	N
waited	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
to	N	N
arrive	N	N
.	N	N
	
There	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
map	N	N
of	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
routes	N	C
at	N	N
the	N	N
stop	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
looked	N	N
on	N	N
there	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
knew	N	N
which	N	N
bus	N	N
would	N	N
take	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
zoo	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
saw	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
bus	N	N
number	N	N
12	N	N
.	N	N
	
Sure	N	N
enough	N	N
,	N	N
there	N	N
came	N	N
number	N	N
12	N	N
.	N	N
	
As	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
pulled	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
stop	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
driver	N	N
opened	N	N
the	N	N
door	N	N
to	N	N
let	N	N
passengers	N	C
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
everyone	N	N
who	N	N
need	N	N
off	N	N
was	N	N
off	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
climbed	N	C
up	N	N
the	N	N
stairs	N	N
,	N	N
smiled	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
driver	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
money	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
slot	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
and	N	N
off	N	N
we	N	N
went	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
watched	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
buildings	N	N
go	N	N
by	N	N
as	N	N
the	N	N
driver	N	N
drove	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
towards	N	N
the	N	N
zoo	N	C
.	N	N
	
There	N	N
were	N	N
a	N	N
couple	N	N
of	N	N
other	N	N
stops	N	N
before	N	N
the	N	N
zoo	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
at	N	N
each	N	N
one	N	N
people	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
and	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
Finally	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
made	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
zoo	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
driver	N	N
opened	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
door	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
climbed	N	C
down	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
and	N	N
off	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
day	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
zoo	N	C
.	N	N
	
Tonight	N	N
I	N	N
road	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
public	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
waited	N	N
outside	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
near	N	N
my	N	N
house	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
which	N	N
runs	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
schedule	C	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
came	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
and	N	N
paid	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
fare	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
I	N	N
looked	N	N
around	N	N
at	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
other	N	N
people	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
you	N	N
ride	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
there	N	N
can	N	N
be	N	N
all	N	N
types	N	N
of	N	N
people	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
with	N	N
you	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
my	N	N
MP3	N	C
player	N	N
with	N	N
me	N	N
with	N	N
ear-buds	N	C
so	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
ear-buds	N	C
into	N	N
my	N	N
ears	N	N
and	N	N
turned	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
MP3	N	C
player	N	N
and	N	N
began	N	N
listening	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
music	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
public	N	N
bus	N	N
ride	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
very	N	N
long	N	N
so	N	N
after	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
while	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stopped	N	N
at	N	N
my	N	N
stop	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
and	N	N
arrived	N	N
at	N	N
my	N	N
destination	N	C
.	N	N
	
Riding	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
public	N	N
bus	N	N
can	N	N
be	N	N
a	N	N
fun	N	N
experience	N	N
if	N	N
you	N	N
want	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
and	N	N
you	N	N
can	N	N
even	N	N
talk	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
other	N	N
people	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
public	N	N
bus	N	N
but	N	N
overall	C	C
I	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
experience	N	N
.	N	N
	
There	N	N
is	N	N
a	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
street	N	N
from	N	N
my	N	N
house	N	N
.	N	N
	
If	N	N
you	N	N
take	N	N
it	N	N
going	N	N
south	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
leads	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
city	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
if	N	N
you	N	N
take	N	N
it	N	N
going	N	N
north	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
leads	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
next	N	N
suburban	N	C
town	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
city	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
and	N	N
waited	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
waited	N	N
about	N	N
ten	N	N
minutes	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
came	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
wheezed	N	C
to	N	N
a	N	N
stop	N	N
near	N	N
me	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
the	N	N
door	N	N
opened	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
and	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
short	N	N
flight	N	N
of	N	N
stairs	N	N
toward	N	N
the	N	N
driver	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
just	N	N
enough	N	N
change	N	N
on	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
pay	N	N
the	N	N
fare	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
fed	N	C
my	N	N
coins	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
slot	C	C
where	N	N
you	N	N
put	N	N
your	N	N
money	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
walked	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
left	N	N
and	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
aisle	N	C
to	N	N
find	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
passed	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
seats	N	N
,	N	N
which	N	N
are	N	N
intended	N	C
for	N	N
older	N	N
or	N	N
handicapped	N	C
passengers	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
about	N	N
halfway	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
,	N	N
next	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
ride	N	N
lasted	N	C
15	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
saw	N	N
that	N	N
my	N	N
stop	N	N
would	N	N
be	N	N
next	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
pulled	N	N
the	N	N
yellow	N	N
cord	N	C
that	N	N
runs	N	N
along	N	N
the	N	N
side	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
That	N	N
makes	N	N
a	N	N
beep	N	C
and	N	N
signals	N	C
the	N	N
driver	N	N
that	N	N
someone	N	N
wants	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
beep	N	C
sounded	N	C
and	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
driver	N	N
pulled	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
side	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
road	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
next	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
doors	N	N
opened	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
rear	C	N
door	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
,	N	N
walked	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
stairs	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
walked	N	N
out	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N
sidewalk	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
waited	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
bus	N	N
to	N	N
come	N	N
pick	N	N
me	N	N
up	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
seemed	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
running	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
behind	N	N
today	N	N
.	N	N
	
Finally	N	N
,	N	N
at	N	N
8:03	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
pulled	N	N
up	N	N
.	N	N
	
There	N	N
were	N	N
other	N	N
people	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
stop	N	N
as	N	N
well	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
waited	N	N
in	N	N
lined	N	C
for	N	N
my	N	N
turn	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
on	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
climbed	N	C
the	N	N
three	N	N
steps	N	N
up	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
deposited	N	C
my	N	N
change	N	N
to	N	N
pay	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
trip	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
fare	N	C
was	N	N
$	N	N
1.5	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
six	N	N
quarters	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
box	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
walked	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
aisle	N	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
and	N	N
looked	N	N
for	N	N
an	N	N
empty	N	N
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
found	C	N
one	N	N
next	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
young	N	N
person	N	N
listening	N	N
to	N	N
music	N	N
on	N	N
their	N	N
headphones	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
pulled	N	N
away	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
curb	C	C
.	N	N
	
As	N	N
we	N	N
rode	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
looked	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
and	N	N
watched	N	N
the	N	N
stores	N	N
and	N	N
houses	N	N
pass	N	N
by	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
about	N	N
10	N	N
minutes	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
reached	N	N
my	N	N
stop	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
waited	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
to	N	N
come	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
complete	N	N
stop	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
exited	N	C
,	N	N
steeping	N	C
down	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
stepping	N	N
back	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
curb	C	C
onto	N	N
the	N	N
sidewalk	N	C
.	N	N
	
Time	N	N
to	N	N
start	N	N
another	N	N
day	N	N
!	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
college	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
big	N	N
city	N	N
and	N	N
did	N	N
n't	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
car	N	N
on	N	N
campus	C	N
.	N	N
	
Thankfully	C	C
,	N	N
there	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
a	N	N
need	N	N
for	N	N
one	N	N
because	N	N
the	N	N
public	N	N
transportation	C	C
system	N	N
was	N	N
great	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
often	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
visit	N	N
my	N	N
friend	N	N
that	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
school	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
other	N	N
side	N	N
of	N	N
town	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
always	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
public	N	N
bus	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
there	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
first	N	N
thing	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
do	N	N
is	N	N
look	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
route	N	C
and	N	N
schedule	C	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
knew	N	N
what	N	N
time	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
would	N	N
arrive	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
'd	N	N
walk	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
and	N	N
wait	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bench	C	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
arrived	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
pay	N	N
the	N	N
driver	N	N
via	N	N
a	N	N
electronic	N	C
machine	N	N
and	N	N
was	N	N
then	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
life	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
would	N	N
make	N	N
many	N	N
stops	N	N
before	N	N
arriving	N	N
at	N	N
mine	N	N
.	N	N
	
At	N	N
one	N	N
point	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
was	N	N
full	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
gave	N	N
up	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
so	N	N
that	N	N
an	N	N
older	N	N
lady	N	N
could	N	N
sit	N	N
down	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
saw	N	N
that	N	N
my	N	N
stop	N	N
was	N	N
arriving	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
pulled	N	N
the	N	N
lever	N	C
to	N	N
let	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
driver	N	N
know	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
depart	N	C
the	N	N
bus	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
next	N	N
stop	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
thanked	N	C
the	N	N
driver	N	N
and	N	N
was	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
way	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
really	N	N
like	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
run	N	N
errands	N	C
.	N	N
	
There	N	N
is	N	N
a	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
right	N	N
outside	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
apartment	N	N
building	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
wait	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
pulls	N	N
up	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
pay	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
fare	N	C
using	N	N
quarters	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
costs	N	N
six	N	N
quarters	N	C
to	N	N
ride	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
makes	N	N
lots	N	N
of	N	N
different	N	N
stops	N	N
before	N	N
it	N	N
gets	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
grocery	N	N
store	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
am	N	N
on	N	N
it	N	N
for	N	N
several	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
sit	N	N
quietly	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
Sometimes	N	N
other	N	N
people	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
will	N	N
say	N	N
hello	N	N
and	N	N
we	N	N
will	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
small	N	N
conversation	N	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
get	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
and	N	N
finish	N	N
shopping	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
wait	N	N
at	N	N
another	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
can	N	N
go	N	N
home	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
pay	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
fare	N	C
again	N	N
,	N	N
sit	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
and	N	N
patiently	C	C
wait	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
apartment	N	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
it	N	N
stops	N	N
in	N	N
front	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
apartment	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
get	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
and	N	N
go	N	N
inside	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
from	N	N
my	N	N
house	N	N
to	N	N
work	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
my	N	N
car	N	N
wouldn	N	N
'	N	N
t	N	N
start	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	N
my	N	N
best	N	N
option	N	C
was	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
street	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
nearest	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
that	N	N
would	N	N
take	N	N
me	N	N
close	N	N
to	N	N
work	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
waited	N	N
for	N	N
about	N	N
five	N	N
minutes	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
to	N	N
come	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
money	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
machine	N	N
and	N	N
headed	N	N
towards	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
find	N	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
There	N	N
were	N	N
only	N	N
three	N	N
open	N	N
seats	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
them	N	N
and	N	N
popped	N	C
in	N	N
my	N	N
ear	N	N
buds	N	C
to	N	N
listen	N	N
to	N	N
music	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
also	N	N
brought	N	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
along	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
so	N	N
nobody	N	N
would	N	N
try	N	N
to	N	N
talk	N	N
to	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
made	N	N
three	N	N
stops	N	N
before	N	N
we	N	N
got	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
corner	N	N
nearest	N	C
to	N	N
my	N	N
work	N	N
.	N	N
	
Each	N	N
time	N	N
people	N	N
would	N	N
get	N	N
off	N	N
and	N	N
as	N	N
they	N	N
shuffled	N	C
past	N	N
would	N	N
bump	C	C
into	N	N
my	N	N
knees	N	N
which	N	N
was	N	N
really	N	N
annoying	N	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
more	N	N
people	N	N
would	N	N
get	N	N
on	N	N
and	N	N
some	N	N
would	N	N
find	N	N
seats	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
others	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
stand	N	N
.	N	N
	
One	N	N
person	N	N
stood	N	N
directly	N	N
in	N	N
front	N	N
of	N	N
me	N	N
,	N	N
in	N	N
constant	C	C
contact	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
legs	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
really	N	N
annoyed	N	C
me	N	N
even	N	N
more	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
don	N	N
'	N	N
t	N	N
like	N	N
riding	N	N
public	N	N
transportation	C	C
.	N	N
	
Finally	N	N
we	N	N
got	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
stop	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
through	N	N
the	N	N
rear	C	N
doors	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
waiting	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
as	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
hot	N	N
day	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
happy	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
shady	N	C
bench	C	C
.	N	N
	
More	N	N
people	N	N
gathered	N	C
around	N	N
the	N	N
stop	N	N
,	N	N
getting	N	N
on	N	N
and	N	N
off	N	N
other	N	N
buses	N	N
,	N	N
as	N	N
I	N	N
waited	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
bus	N	N
to	N	N
arrive	N	N
.	N	N
	
Finally	N	N
,	N	N
a	N	N
bus	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
number	N	N
on	N	N
it	N	N
,	N	N
arrived	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
felt	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
like	N	N
a	N	N
rush	C	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
on	N	N
,	N	N
by	N	N
finally	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
paid	N	N
my	N	N
fair	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
looked	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
place	N	N
to	N	N
sit	N	N
.	N	N
	
Not	N	N
finding	N	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
placed	N	N
my	N	N
shopping	N	N
bag	N	N
between	N	N
my	N	N
feet	N	N
and	N	N
stood	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
stops	N	N
,	N	N
holding	N	N
the	N	N
handhold	N	C
hanging	N	C
from	N	N
the	N	N
ceiling	N	N
.	N	N
	
Finally	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
cleared	N	C
out	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
able	C	N
to	N	N
find	N	N
a	N	N
place	N	N
to	N	N
sit	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
read	N	N
my	N	N
book	N	N

looking	N	N
occasionally	C	C
out	N	N
the	N	N
windows	N	N

until	N	N
finally	N	N
reaching	N	N
the	N	N

for	N	N
home	N	N

Even	N	N
though	N	N
I	N	N
stepped	N	N
carefully	N	C
off	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
stumble	C	C
slightly	C	N
on	N	N
one	N	N
the	N	N
steps	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
promised	N	N
myself	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
more	N	N
careful	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
future	N	N

I	N	N
needed	N	N

but	N	N
my	N	N
car	N	N
was	N	N
not	N	N

I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
public	N	N
bus	N	N

I	N	N
walked	N	N

I	N	N

fare	N	C
and	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N

I	N	N
sat	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N

as	N	N
it	N	N
passed	N	N
by	N	N
all	N	N

made	N	N
it	N	N
my	N	N

on	N	N
time	N	N

I	N	N
walked	N	N
from	N	N

down	N	N

Then	N	N

Yesterday	N	N

checked	N	N

bus	N	N
schedule	C	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
computer	N	N

Around	N	N

time	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
would	N	N
be	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
area	N	N

I	N	N

from	N	N
my	N	N
house	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N

I	N	N

the	N	N
front	N	N

we	N	N

The	N	N

Before	N	N

the	N	N

the	N	N

The	N	N
trick	N	N
to	N	N
getting	N	N
around	N	N
an	N	N
island	N	N
as	N	N
congested	N	C
with	N	N
traffic	N	C
as	N	N
Oahu	N	N
,	N	N
is	N	N
to	N	N
ride	N	N
the	N	N
public	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
There	N	N
are	N	N
too	N	N
many	N	N
cars	N	N
,	N	N
in	N	N
too	N	N
small	N	N
of	N	N
an	N	N
area	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
result	N	N
is	N	N
hours	N	N
of	N	N
gridlock	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
roads	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bus	N	N
can	N	N
use	N	N
special	N	N
lanes	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
helps	N	N
reduce	N	N

Learning	C	N
to	N	N
ride	N	N
the	N	N
public	N	N
bus	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
stressful	N	C
at	N	N
first	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
studied	N	C
bus	N	N
routes	N	C
online	N	N
on	N	N
their	N	N
website	N	N
,	N	N
there	N	N
are	N	N
quite	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
and	N	N
it	N	N
seemed	N	N
like	N	N
it	N	N
'd	N	N
be	N	N
easy	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
wrong	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
learned	N	N
each	N	N
bus	N	N
has	N	N
a	N	N
number	N	N
assigned	N	C
to	N	N
it	N	N
and	N	N
displayed	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
though	N	N
.	N	N
	
With	N	N
that	N	N
in	N	N
mind	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
armed	C	C
with	N	N
maps	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
learned	N	N
to	N	N
stand	N	N
at	N	N
my	N	N
local	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
and	N	N
climb	N	N
on	N	N
board	N	N
where	N	N
I	N	N
drop	N	N
my	N	N
change	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
toll	C	C
taker	N	C
next	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
driver	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
always	N	N
look	N	N
for	N	N
an	N	N
empty	N	N
seat	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
relax	N	N
,	N	N
watching	N	N
the	N	N
scenery	N	C
roll	N	N
by	N	N
.	N	N
	
As	N	N
my	N	N
stop	N	N
approaches	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
stand	N	N
and	N	N
pull	N	N
the	N	N
bell	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
driver	N	N
stops	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
Now	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
regularly	N	C
ride	N	N
the	N	N
public	N	N
bus	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
find	N	N
I	N	N
do	N	N
n't	N	N

the	N	N
long	N	N
commute	C	C
nearly	N	N

Do	N	N
n't	N	N
own	N	N
a	N	N
car	N	N

Tired	N	C
of	N	N
walking	N	N
around	N	N
?	N	N
Well	N	N
I	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
perfect	N	N
solution	N	N
for	N	N
you	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
it	N	N
's	N	N
right	N	N
under	N	N
your	N	N
nose	N	N
.	N	N
	
Head	N	N
to	N	N
your	N	N
local	N	N
corner	N	N
bus	N	N
stop	N	N
and	N	N
travel	N	N
on	N	N
another	N	N
form	N	N
of	N	N
transportation	C	C
!	N	N
It	N	N
's	N	N
very	N	N
simple	N	N
if	N	N
you	N	N
live	N	N
in	N	N
an	N	N
Urban	C	C
setting	C	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
still	N	N
pretty	N	N
simple	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
suburbs	N	C
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
good	N	N
resource	C	C
first	N	N
is	N	N
to	N	N
look	N	N
up	N	N
a	N	N
bus	N	N
schedule	C	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
internet	N	N
.	N	N
	
Additionally	C	C
,	N	N
you	N	N
could	N	N
search	N	N
the	N	N
sidewalks	N	C
for	N	N
prominent	C	C
signage	N	C
that	N	N
indicates	N	C
a	N	N
bus	N	N
will	N	N
stop	N	N
in	N	N
your	N	N
area	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
you	N	N
decide	N	N
on	N	N
where	N	N
you	N	N
want	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
time	N	N
at	N	N
which	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
comes	N	N
,	N	N
just	N	N
head	N	N
out	N	N
to	N	N
this	N	N
stop	N	N
and	N	N
simply	C	N
wait	N	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
bus	N	N
will	N	N
eventually	C	C
show	N	N
up	N	N
where	N	N
you	N	N
can	N	N
board	N	N
and	N	N
pay	N	N
directly	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bus	N	N
driver	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
paid	N	N
,	N	N
simply	C	N
find	N	N
an	N	N
open	N	N
seat	N	N
and	N	N
gaze	C	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
bustling	N	C
of	N	N
life	N	N
that	N	N
you	N	N
are	N	N
passing	N	N
by	N	N
.	N	N
	
Eventually	C	C
you	N	N
will	N	N
arrive	N	N
at	N	N
your	N	N
destination	N	C
and	N	N
can	N	N
exit	N	C
the	N	N
bus	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
you	N	N
finish	N	N
running	N	N
your	N	N
errands	N	C
simply	C	N
return	N	N
to	N	N
another	N	N
bus	N	N
spot	N	N
and	N	N
find	N	N
a	N	N
ride	N	N
home	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
like	N	N
to	N	N
cook	N	N
a	N	N
lot	N	N
but	N	N
I	N	N
am	N	N
not	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
good	N	N
baker	N	C
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
I	N	N
never	N	N
bake	N	C
cakes	N	N
from	N	N
scratch	C	C
.	N	N
	
However	N	N
I	N	N
do	N	N
like	N	N
cake	N	N
al	N	N
ot	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
do	N	N
bake	N	C
them	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
use	N	N
box	N	N
mixes	N	C
.	N	N
	
They	N	N
are	N	N
easy	N	N
to	N	N
use	N	N
and	N	N
make	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
nice	N	N
cake	N	N
.	N	N
	
it	N	N
really	N	N
does	N	N
n't	N	N
take	N	N
much	N	N
time	N	N
.	N	N
	
All	N	N
you	N	N
need	N	N
to	N	N
do	N	N
is	N	N
get	N	N
one	N	N
bowl	N	C
.	N	N
	
Add	N	N
the	N	N
cake	N	N
mix	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
box	N	N
.	N	N
	
Either	N	N
2	N	N
or	N	N
3	N	N
eggs	N	N
added	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bowl	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
a	N	N
half	N	N
cup	N	N
of	N	N
oil	N	N
and	N	N
finally	N	N
about	N	N
a	N	N
cup	N	N
of	N	N
water	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
you	N	N
need	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
your	N	N
mixer	N	C
and	N	N
put	N	N
it	N	N
on	N	N
medium	N	C
and	N	N
mix	N	N
it	N	N
all	N	N
up	N	N
for	N	N
2	N	N
to	N	N
3	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
put	N	N
it	N	N
into	N	N
a	N	N
non	N	N
stick	N	N
cake	N	N
pan	N	N
and	N	N
bake	N	C
for	N	N
about	N	N
30	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
all	N	N
together	N	N
about	N	N
10	N	N
minutes	N	N
preparation	N	C
and	N	N
30	N	N
minutes	N	N
baking	N	C
you	N	N
can	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
tasting	N	C
cake	N	N
in	N	N
40	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
do	N	N
n't	N	N
really	N	N
like	N	N
frosting	N	C
so	N	N
as	N	N
soon	N	N
as	N	N
it	N	N
cools	N	C
I	N	N
cut	N	N
myself	N	N
a	N	N
slice	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
my	N	N
son	N	N
's	N	N
birthday	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
bake	N	C
him	N	N
a	N	N
birthday	N	N
cake	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
and	N	N
bought	N	N
chocolate	N	N
cake	N	N
mix	N	N
,	N	N
oil	N	N
,	N	N
eggs	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
frosting	N	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
set	N	N
about	N	N
making	N	N
the	N	N
cake	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
turned	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
oven	N	C
to	N	N
preheat	N	C
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
big	N	N
bowl	N	N
to	N	N
mix	N	N
everything	N	N
in	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
put	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
cake	N	N
mix	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
oil	N	N
and	N	N
eggs	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
electric	N	N
beaters	N	C
and	N	N
beat	N	N
the	N	N
concoction	N	C
until	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
smooth	N	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
the	N	N
pan	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
cake	N	N
would	N	N
be	N	N
baked	N	N
in	N	N
and	N	N
greased	N	C
the	N	N
sides	N	N
of	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
poured	N	C
the	N	N
cake	N	N
batter	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
pan	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
pan	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
oven	N	C
that	N	N
had	N	N
been	N	N
preheated	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
set	N	N
a	N	N
timer	N	C
to	N	N
thirty	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
timer	N	C
went	N	N
off	N	N
I	N	N
stuck	C	N
a	N	N
knife	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
cake	N	N
to	N	N
see	N	N
if	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
done	N	N
cooking	N	N
and	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N

I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
try	N	N
baking	N	C
a	N	N
cake	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
first	N	N
time	N	N

Even	N	N
though	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
too	N	N
sure	N	N
about	N	N
how	N	N
to	N	N
do	N	N
it	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
figured	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
have	N	N
fun	N	N
trying	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
looked	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
recipe	N	C
online	N	N

went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N

I	N	N
set	N	N
everything	N	N

the	N	N
kitchen	N	N
counter	C	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N

I	N	N
first	N	N
opened	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
packages	N	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
ingredients	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
followed	N	N
the	N	N
recipe	N	C
in	N	N
full	N	N
detail	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
it	N	N
correctly	N	C
.	N	N
	
As	N	N
soon	N	N
as	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
everything	N	N
properly	N	C
mixed	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
pre-heated	N	C
the	N	N
oven	N	C
and	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
right	N	N
temperature	N	N

When	N	N
the	N	N
timer	N	C
indicated	N	C
the	N	N
oven	N	C
was	N	N
ready	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N

with	N	N
the	N	N
mixed	N	N
cake	N	N
batter	N	C

I	N	N
waited	N	N
for	N	N
forty	N	N
minutes	N	N
until	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
ready	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N

put	N	N
chocolate	N	N
frosting	N	C
on	N	N

The	N	N

came	N	N
out	N	N
pretty	N	N
well	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
first	N	N
time	N	N

I	N	N
decided	N	N

for	N	N
my	N	N
friend	N	N

I	N	N

purchased	N	C
all	N	N

When	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N

I	N	N
turned	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
oven	N	C
to	N	N
let	N	N

I	N	N
opened	N	N

and	N	N
poured	N	C

Following	C	N
the	N	N
instructions	N	C

until	N	N

I	N	N
poured	N	C

put	N	N

While	N	N
the	N	N
cake	N	N
was	N	N
baking	N	C

I	N	N
prepared	N	C
the	N	N

by	N	N
mixing	N	C
powdered	N	C
sugar	N	N

When	N	N
the	N	N

I	N	N

box	N	N

need	N	N
oil	N	N
and	N	N
eggs	N	N

I	N	N
took	N	N

the	N	N
cookbook	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
turned	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
oven	N	C
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
I	N	N
layered	N	C
the	N	N
pineapple	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
baking	N	C
dish	N	N
,	N	N
placed	N	N
the	N	N
cherries	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
center	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
rings	N	N
and	N	N
sprinkled	N	C
the	N	N
brown	N	N
sugar	N	N
on	N	N
.	N	N
	
In	N	N
the	N	N
bowl	N	N
I	N	N
measured	N	C
and	N	N
added	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
dry	N	N
ingredients	N	C
and	N	N
mixed	N	N
them	N	N
before	N	N
adding	N	N
the	N	N

in	N	N
the	N	N
order	N	N
suggested	N	C
by	N	N

recipe	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
stirring	N	C
the	N	N
appropriate	C	C
amount	N	N
of	N	N
time	N	N
I	N	N
carefully	N	C
poured	N	C
the	N	N
batter	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
baking	N	C
dish	N	N
,	N	N
over	N	N
the	N	N
pineapple	N	C

I	N	N
placed	N	N
the	N	N
dish	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
oven	N	C
,	N	N
set	N	N
the	N	N

and	N	N
when	N	N
the	N	N
timer	N	C
rang	N	C
I	N	N
checked	N	N
it	N	N
then	N	N
removed	N	C
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
church	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
pan	N	N
and	N	N
placed	N	N
it	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
tray	C	C
there	N	N
as	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
easier	N	N
to	N	N
transport	N	C
that	N	N
way	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
looked	N	N
delicious	N	C
and	N	N
sold	N	N
for	N	N
more	N	N
than	N	N
any	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
other	N	N
cakes	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
bake	N	C
a	N	N
chocolate	N	N
cake	N	N
yesterday	N	N
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
consulted	N	C
my	N	N
recipe	N	C
book	N	N
and	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
recipe	N	C
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
use	N	N
.	N	N
	
Next	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
looked	N	N
through	N	N
my	N	N
kitchen	N	N
and	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
ingredients	N	C
that	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
cake	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
did	N	N
have	N	N
them	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
began	N	N
to	N	N
pull	N	N
them	N	N
all	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
preheated	N	C
the	N	N
oven	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
greased	N	C
a	N	N
cake	N	N
pan	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
mixed	N	N
up	N	N
all	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
ingredients	N	C
in	N	N
a	N	N
big	N	N
mixing	N	C
bowl	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
poured	N	C
the	N	N
mixture	C	C
carefully	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
cake	N	N
pan	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
carefully	N	C
placed	N	N
it	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
oven	N	C
and	N	N
set	N	N
the	N	N
timer	N	C
according	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
recipe	N	C
.	N	N
	
While	N	N
the	N	N
cake	N	N
was	N	N
baking	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
cleaned	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
mess	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
kitchen	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
made	N	N
chocolate	N	N
frosting	N	C
to	N	N
go	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
cake	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
timer	N	C
buzzed	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
pulled	N	N
the	N	N
cake	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
oven	N	N
and	N	N
saw	N	N
that	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
done	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
set	N	N
it	N	N
out	N	N
to	N	N
cool	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
cool	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
frosting	N	C
I	N	N
had	N	N
just	N	N
made	N	N
and	N	N
frosted	N	C
the	N	N
cake	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
cake	N	N
was	N	N
complete	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
served	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
family	N	N
for	N	N
dessert	N	C
after	N	N
dinner	N	N
that	N	N
night	N	N
.	N	N
	
Just	N	N
the	N	N
other	N	N
day	N	N
I	N	N
baked	N	C
a	N	N
cake	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
recipe	N	C
online	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
chocolate	N	N
cake	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
really	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
try	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
and	N	N
bought	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
ingredients	N	C

Then	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
home	N	N

put	N	N
everything	N	N
out	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N

baking	N	C
dish	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
first	N	N
thing	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
was	N	N
to	N	N
mix	N	N

I	N	N
then	N	N
greased	N	C
up	N	N
my	N	N
baking	N	C
dish	N	N
with	N	N
oil	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
the	N	N
cake	N	N
would	N	N
n't	N	N
stick	N	N
to	N	N
it	N	N
while	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
baking	N	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
set	N	N
the	N	N
oven	N	C

to	N	N
350	N	N
degrees	N	N
and	N	N
let	N	N

After	N	N
all	N	N
my	N	N
ingredients	N	C
were	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
bowl	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
used	N	N
a	N	N
big	N	N
spoon	N	C
to	N	N
stir	N	C
everything	N	N
together	N	N
until	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
nice	N	N
and	N	N
mixed	N	N
up	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
poured	N	C
the	N	N
batter	N	C
into	N	N
my	N	N
baking	N	C
dish	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N

I	N	N
let	N	N
it	N	N
bake	N	C
for	N	N
an	N	N
hour	N	N
,	N	N
then	N	N
took	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
cake	N	N
and	N	N
let	N	N
it	N	N
cool	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
cool	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
icing	N	C
on	N	N
it	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
cut	N	N
it	N	N
into	N	N
pieces	N	N
to	N	N
save	N	N
for	N	N
later	N	N

Then	N	N
I	N	N
cleaned	N	N
up	N	N

It	N	N

along	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N

put	N	N
them	N	N
into	N	N

I	N	N
used	N	N
the	N	N

mixer	N	C
to	N	N
mix	N	N
the	N	N
batter	N	C
until	N	N
it	N	N

I	N	N
greased	N	C

put	N	N
a	N	N

the	N	N
bottom	N	N
and	N	N
shook	N	N
it	N	N
around	N	N

This	N	N
would	N	N
keep	N	N
the	N	N

from	N	N
sticking	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
pan	N	N
while	N	N
it	N	N

I	N	N
poured	N	C

placed	N	N

I	N	N
set	N	N

While	N	N

vanilla	N	C
and	N	N
milk	N	N
to	N	N

When	N	N

I	N	N
took	N	N

putting	N	N

Before	N	N
you	N	N

up	N	N
a	N	N
bottle	N	N

water	N	N

a	N	N

You	N	N

,	N	N
hopefully	N	C
,	N	N
you	N	N
wo	N	N
n't	N	N
have	N	N

go	N	N

the	N	N

If	N	N
you	N	N
have	N	N
an	N	N

your	N	N

do	N	N
n't	N	N
rush	C	N

get	N	N

it	N	N

a	N	N
longer	N	N

at	N	N

Try	N	N

Last	N	N
week	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
flew	N	C
in	N	N
an	N	N
airplane	N	C
to	N	N
visit	N	N
a	N	N
different	N	N
state	C	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
I	N	N
parked	N	C
my	N	N
car	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
parking	N	N
lot	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
right	N	N
ticket	N	N
counter	C	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
airline	N	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
turned	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
suitcase	N	C
so	N	N
it	N	N
could	N	N
travel	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
cargo	C	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
place	N	N
called	N	N
a	N	N
gate	N	N
which	N	N
is	N	N
really	N	N
just	N	N
an	N	N
indoor	N	C
place	N	N
to	N	N
wait	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
plane	N	N
to	N	N
arrive	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
has	N	N
a	N	N
big	N	N
window	N	N
where	N	N
I	N	N
watched	N	N
the	N	N
planes	N	N
and	N	N
waited	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
turn	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
on	N	N
one	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
my	N	N
plane	N	N
arrived	N	N
,	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
flight	N	N
attendant	N	C
showed	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
sat	N	N
down	N	N
to	N	N
wait	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
seat	N	N
was	N	N
comfortable	N	C
,	N	N
but	N	N
small	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
there	N	N
were	N	N
people	N	N
sitting	N	N
on	N	N
each	N	N
side	N	N
of	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
everyone	N	N
settled	N	C
in	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
started	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
drove	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
runway	C	C
to	N	N
wait	N	N
its	N	N
turn	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
we	N	N
took	N	N
off	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
rose	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
air	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
leveled	N	C
off	N	N
to	N	N
what	N	N
the	N	N
pilot	N	N
called	N	N
cruising	N	C
speed	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
the	N	N
flight	N	N
attendants	N	C
brought	N	N
around	N	N
food	N	N
and	N	N
drinks	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
plane	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
noisy	N	C
,	N	N
but	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
fun	N	N
to	N	N
watch	N	N
the	N	N
people	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
food	N	N
was	N	N
pretty	N	N
good	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
plane	N	N
ride	N	N
was	N	N
short	N	N
and	N	N
we	N	N
had	N	N
barely	C	N
finished	N	N
our	N	N
food	N	N
and	N	N
drinks	N	N
before	N	N
the	N	N
pilot	N	N
said	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
time	N	N
to	N	N
land	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
next	N	N
town	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
flight	N	N
attendants	N	C
came	N	N
back	N	N
around	N	N
to	N	N
pick	N	N
up	N	N
our	N	N
trash	C	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
we	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
buckle	N	C
our	N	N
seat	N	N
belts	N	C
again	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
to	N	N
land	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
fun	N	N
trip	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
hope	N	N
I	N	N
get	N	N
to	N	N
do	N	N
it	N	N
again	N	N
sometime	N	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
month	N	N

I	N	N
bought	N	N
a	N	N

I	N	N
chose	N	N

was	N	N

The	N	N

I	N	N
arrived	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N

I	N	N

Two	N	N

I	N	N
put	N	N

The	N	N

Everyone	N	N

locked	N	N
up	N	N
their	N	N

The	N	N

to	N	N
us	N	N
over	N	N
the	N	N

,	N	N
telling	N	N
us	N	N

that	N	N

reach	N	N
our	N	N
destination	N	C
in	N	N
a	N	N
short	N	N
time	N	N

The	N	N

sped	N	C
forward	N	N

and	N	N
off	N	N
we	N	N
soared	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N

My	N	N
ears	N	N
popped	N	C
from	N	N
the	N	N
change	N	N
in	N	N
air	N	N
pressure	C	N
but	N	N
it	N	N
only	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
moments	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
body	N	N
to	N	N
acclimate	N	C
itself	N	N

The	N	N

The	N	N

It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N

kind	N	N
of	N	N
fun	N	N
,	N	N
too	N	N

I	N	N
decided	N	N
not	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N

so	N	N
I	N	N
simply	C	N

Beside	N	N

made	N	N
small	N	N

took	N	N
off	N	N

She	N	N

awhile	N	C
before	N	N
I	N	N
too	N	N
fell	N	N
asleep	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
awoke	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
sound	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
flight	N	N
attendant	N	C
informing	N	C
us	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
would	N	N
soon	N	N
be	N	N
landing	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
almost	N	N
barfed	N	C
as	N	N
we	N	N
made	N	N
our	N	N
decent	C	C
,	N	N
but	N	N
managed	N	N
to	N	N
hold	N	N
it	N	N
in	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
we	N	N
landed	N	C
I	N	N
departed	N	C
the	N	N
plane	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
other	N	N
passengers	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
so	N	N
excited	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
first	N	N
trip	N	N
to	N	N
Florida	N	N
by	N	N
airplane	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
buy	N	N
a	N	N
window	N	N
seat	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
see	N	N
the	N	N
beautiful	N	N
view	N	N
from	N	N
high	N	N
up	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
sky	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
listened	N	C
carefully	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
flight	N	N
attendant	N	C
as	N	N
she	N	N
gave	N	N
her	N	N
speech	N	N
about	N	N
safety	C	N
precautions	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
she	N	N
finished	N	N
the	N	N
pilot	N	C
got	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
loud	N	N
speaker	N	C
and	N	N
informed	N	C
us	N	N
that	N	N
we	N	N
will	N	N
be	N	N
taking	N	N
off	N	N
shortly	C	C
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
told	N	N
us	N	N
what	N	N
time	N	N
we	N	N
will	N	N
be	N	N
landing	C	C
in	N	N
Florida	N	N
and	N	N
even	N	N
the	N	N
temperature	N	C
it	N	N
will	N	N
be	N	N
when	N	N
we	N	N
landed	N	C
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
then	N	N
told	N	N
us	N	N
to	N	N
buckle	N	C
our	N	N
seat	N	N
belt	N	N
and	N	N
turn	N	N
off	N	N
any	N	N
electronic	N	C
devices	N	C
we	N	N
may	N	N
have	N	N
with	N	N
us	N	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
couple	N	N
minutes	N	N
later	N	N
the	N	N
engine	N	N
came	N	N
to	N	N
life	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
started	N	N
moving	C	N
towards	N	N
the	N	N
runway	C	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
it	N	N
reach	N	N
the	N	N
runway	C	C
it	N	N
started	N	N
to	N	N
speed	N	N
up	N	N
very	N	N
fast	N	N
and	N	N
after	N	N
a	N	N
minute	N	N
I	N	N
felt	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
lift	N	C
off	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
looked	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
and	N	N
saw	N	N
us	N	N
leaving	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
we	N	N
reach	N	N
our	N	N
cruising	N	C
altitude	N	C
the	N	N
pilot	N	N
informed	N	C
us	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
now	N	N
safe	N	N
for	N	N
us	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
off	N	N
our	N	N
seat	N	N
belts	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
looked	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
and	N	N
found	C	N
myself	N	N
amazed	N	C
as	N	N
we	N	N
soared	N	C
over	N	N
the	N	N
clouds	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
a	N	N
couple	N	N
days	C	N
from	N	N
ordering	N	C
the	N	N
plane	N	N
tickets	N	N
online	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
drove	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
airport	N	C
which	N	N
took	N	N
about	N	N
45	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
Upon	C	N
arriving	N	C
there	N	N
I	N	N
parked	N	C
my	N	N
car	N	N
and	N	N
walked	N	N
inside	N	N
the	N	N
airport	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
through	N	N
security	N	C
first	N	N
which	N	N
checked	N	N
everything	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
walked	N	N
to	N	N
find	N	N
the	N	N
wing	N	N
where	N	N
my	N	N
assigned	N	C
airplane	N	C
was	N	N
at	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
it	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
drop	N	N
off	N	N
my	N	N
luggage	N	C
and	N	N
go	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
clerk	N	C
with	N	N
my	N	N
plane	N	N
ticket	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
she	N	N
inspects	N	C
it	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
go	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
airplane	N	C
and	N	N
sit	N	N
onto	N	N
my	N	N
assigned	N	C
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
Since	N	N
this	N	N
was	N	N
my	N	N
first	N	N
ride	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
not	N	N
sit	N	N
near	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
in	N	N
order	N	N
to	N	N
prevent	N	C
getting	N	N
sick	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
filled	N	C
up	N	N
with	N	N
more	N	N
people	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
ended	N	N
up	N	N
taking	N	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
During	N	N
the	N	N
ride	N	N
everyone	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
quite	N	C
and	N	N
there	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
movie	N	N
playing	N	N
during	N	N
the	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
2	N	N
hours	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
arrived	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
next	N	N
airport	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
picked	N	N
up	N	N
my	N	N
luggage	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
met	N	N
up	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
friend	N	N
who	N	N
met	N	N
me	N	N
there	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	C
in	N	N
advance	C	C
and	N	N
checked	N	C
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
my	N	N
flight	N	N
was	N	N
not	N	N
canceled	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
pre-packed	N	C
what	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
and	N	N
doubled	N	N
checked	N	N
the	N	N
list	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
that	N	N
all	N	N
my	N	N
items	N	C
were	N	N
approved	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
arrived	N	C
at	N	N
the	N	N
airport	N	C
about	N	N
one	N	N
and	N	N
a	N	N
half	N	N
hours	N	N
early	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
through	N	N
security	N	C
first	N	N
,	N	N
since	N	N
there	N	N
were	N	N
long	N	N
lines	N	N
for	N	N
that	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
off	N	N
my	N	N
shoes	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
bags	N	N
through	N	N
an	N	N
x-ray	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
done	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
luggage	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
correct	N	N
area	N	N
so	N	N
it	N	N
could	N	N
be	N	N
loaded	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
waited	N	N
until	N	N
my	N	N
plane	N	N
was	N	N
ready	N	N
to	N	N
board	N	N
and	N	N
showed	N	N
the	N	N
flight	N	N
attendant	N	C
my	N	N
boarding	N	C
pass	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
stayed	N	N
quietly	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
and	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
assigned	N	C
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
can	N	N
be	N	N
crowded	N	C
and	N	N
boring	N	C
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
read	N	N
my	N	N
book	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
flight	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
listen	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
flight	N	N
attendants	N	C
when	N	N
they	N	N
had	N	N
an	N	N
announcement	N	C
to	N	N
make	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
waited	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
seating	N	C
area	N	N
near	N	N
the	N	N
gate	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
airport	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
could	N	N
see	N	N
the	N	N
huge	N	N
jetliner	N	C
out	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
looked	N	N
at	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	C
and	N	N
saw	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
in	N	N
Group	N	N
3	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
gate	N	C
attendant	N	C
called	N	N
my	N	N
number	N	N
I	N	N
showed	N	N
her	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	C
and	N	N
boarded	N	C
the	N	N
plane	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
found	C	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
,	N	N
22D	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
sat	N	N
down	N	N
,	N	N
putting	N	N
the	N	N
small	N	N
bag	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
packed	C	N
under	N	N
the	N	N
seat	N	N
in	N	N
front	N	N
of	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
everyone	N	N
was	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
they	N	N
shut	N	N
the	N	N
door	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
flight	N	N
attendant	N	C
made	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
announcements	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
buckled	N	C
myself	N	N
in	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
plane	N	N
pulled	N	N
away	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
gate	N	N
and	N	N
taxied	N	C
to	N	N
a	N	N
runway	C	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
sat	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
runway	C	C
for	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
minutes	N	N
before	N	N
we	N	N
were	N	N
given	N	N
approval	C	C
to	N	N
take	N	N
off	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
pushed	N	N
back	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
and	N	N
we	N	N
accelerated	N	C
down	N	N
the	N	N
runway	C	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
nose	N	C
lifted	N	C
and	N	N
we	N	N
were	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
air	N	N
.	N	N
	
During	N	N
the	N	N
flight	N	C
I	N	N
got	N	N
a	N	N
drink	N	N
.	N	N
	
One	N	N
hour	N	N
later	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
set	N	N
down	N	N
in	N	N
Cleveland	N	N

Success	N	C
!	N	N
Five	N	N
years	N	N
ago	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
New	N	N
York	N	N
City	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
live	N	N
in	N	N
Missouri	N	C
,	N	N
so	N	N
New	N	N
York	N	N
City	N	N
is	N	N
very	N	N
far	N	N
away	N	N
from	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
buy	N	N
plain	N	N
tickets	N	C
so	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
ride	N	N
in	N	N
an	N	N
airplane	N	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
there	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
never	N	N
ridden	N	C
on	N	N
an	N	N
airplane	N	C
before	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
bit	N	N
nervous	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
ordered	N	N
my	N	N
plane	N	N
tickets	N	N
online	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
sister	N	N
drove	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
airport	N	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
there	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
counter	C	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
my	N	N
luggage	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
lady	N	N
working	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
counter	C	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
nice	N	N
and	N	N
told	N	N
me	N	N
where	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
through	N	N
a	N	N
metal	N	N
detector	N	C
that	N	N
security	N	N
guards	N	N
were	N	N
monitoring	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
found	C	N
my	N	N
airplane	N	C
terminal	C	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
patiently	C	C
waited	N	N
while	N	N
sitting	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
chair	N	N
.	N	N
	
Over	N	N
the	N	N
speakers	N	C
,	N	N
a	N	N
voice	N	N
told	N	N
passengers	N	C
we	N	N
could	N	N
begin	N	N
boarding	N	C
the	N	N
plane	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
ride	N	N
took	N	N
about	N	N
three	N	N
hours	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
pretty	N	N
simple	N	N
experience	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
wife	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
were	N	N
flying	N	N
to	N	N
New	N	N
York	N	N
City	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
vacation	N	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
both	N	N
like	N	N
to	N	N
fly	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
going	N	N
through	N	N
the	N	N
preliminaries	N	C
and	N	N
waiting	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
lounge	C	C
,	N	N
we	N	N
were	N	N
soon	N	N
stepping	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
and	N	N
trying	N	N
to	N	N
find	N	N
our	N	N
seats	N	N
.	N	N
	
Planes	N	C
can	N	N
be	N	N
crowded	N	C
when	N	N
one	N	N
is	N	N
getting	N	N
on	N	N
or	N	N
off	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
we	N	N
found	C	N
our	N	N
seats	N	N
and	N	N
buckled	N	C
in	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
bit	N	N
of	N	N
time	N	N
for	N	N
everyone	N	N
to	N	N
settle	C	N
in	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
before	N	N
long	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
was	N	N
taxiing	N	C
down	N	N
the	N	N
runway	C	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
lifted	N	C
off	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
feel	N	N
it	N	N
tilt	N	C
to	N	N
one	N	N
side	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
right	N	N
itself	N	N
again	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
fun	N	N
looking	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
and	N	N
seeing	N	N
the	N	N
world	N	N
below	N	N
get	N	N
smaller	N	N
and	N	N
smaller	N	N
,	N	N
then	N	N
disappear	N	C
as	N	N
we	N	N
climbed	N	C
above	N	N
the	N	N
clouds	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
both	N	N
enjoyed	N	C
the	N	N
plane	N	N
ride	N	N
a	N	N
great	N	N
deal	C	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
flight	N	N
attendant	N	C
offered	N	N
us	N	N
drinks	N	N
and	N	N
snacks	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
we	N	N

We	N	N

I	N	N

My	N	N

to	N	N
drop	N	N
me	N	N
off	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
airport	N	C

I	N	N

night	N	N
before	N	N
and	N	N
had	N	N
no	N	N
bags	N	C

so	N	N
I	N	N
walked	N	N
straight	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
security	N	N

Once	N	N

Once	N	N
through	N	N

I	N	N
checked	N	N
the	N	N
monitors	N	C
to	N	N
see	N	N
that	N	N
my	N	N
flight	N	N
was	N	N
on	N	N

The	N	N

was	N	N
very	N	N
smooth	N	C
and	N	N
quiet	N	N

The	N	N
time	N	N

As	N	N
I	N	N

I	N	N
went	N	N
through	N	N

where	N	N
they	N	N
scanned	N	C
my	N	N
purse	N	N
and	N	N
carry-on	N	C

then	N	N
sat	N	N

waited	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
flight	N	N
to	N	N
start	N	N
boarding	N	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
they	N	N
made	N	N
an	N	N
announcement	N	C
that	N	N
my	N	N
plane	N	N
was	N	N
boarding	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
in	N	N
line	N	N
and	N	N
waited	N	N
my	N	N
turn	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
I	N	N
looked	N	N
at	N	N
my	N	N

find	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
number	N	N

sat	N	N

After	N	N
everyone	N	N

the	N	N
pilot	N	N
announced	N	C
we	N	N
were	N	N
clear	N	N
for	N	N
take	N	N
off	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
began	N	N
to	N	N
move	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
wife	N	N
decided	N	C
she	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
beach	N	N
last	N	N
summer	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
decided	N	N
the	N	N
best	N	N
way	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
there	N	N
would	N	N
be	N	N
an	N	N
airplane	N	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
booked	N	C
the	N	N
tickets	N	C
3	N	N
months	N	N
in	N	N
advance	C	N
to	N	N
ensure	C	C
we	N	N
would	N	N
have	N	N
tickets	N	C
to	N	N
board	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
us	N	N
to	N	N
our	N	N
vacation	N	C
destination	N	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
day	N	N
finally	N	N
came	N	N
fly	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
airplane	N	C
,	N	N
we	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
we	N	N
arrived	N	C
at	N	N
least	N	N
an	N	N
hour	N	N
and	N	N
a	N	N
half	N	N
early	N	N
.	N	N
	
There	N	N
are	N	N
many	N	N
delays	N	C
before	N	N
you	N	N
actually	N	C
get	N	N
on	N	N
board	N	N
an	N	N
airplane	N	C
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
,	N	N
,	N	N
you	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
through	N	N
a	N	N
metal	N	N
detector	N	C
and	N	N
wait	N	N
in	N	N
long	N	N
lines	N	N
just	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
metal	N	N
detectors	N	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
you	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
your	N	N
luggage	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
that	N	N
,	N	N
you	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
terminal	C	C
and	N	N
provide	N	C
proof	C	C
of	N	N
a	N	N
ticket	N	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
you	N	N
get	N	N
on	N	N
an	N	N
airplane	N	C
,	N	N
you	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
prepare	N	C
for	N	N
turbulence	N	C
.	N	N
	
Other	N	N
than	N	N
that	N	N
,	N	N
flying	N	N
on	N	N
an	N	N
airplane	N	C
is	N	N
a	N	N
safe	N	N
and	N	N
efficient	N	C
way	N	N
to	N	N
travel	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
we	N	N
landed	N	C
,	N	N
we	N	N
went	N	N
straight	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
beach	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
love	N	N
to	N	N
travel	N	N
the	N	N
USA	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
recently	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
world	N	N
.	N	N
	
Without	N	N
the	N	N
advent	N	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
modern	N	N
airplane	N	C
this	N	N
would	N	N
be	N	N
both	N	N
very	N	N
time	N	N
consuming	N	C
and	N	N
very	N	N
expensive	N	N
.	N	N
	
To	N	N
save	N	N
money	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
like	N	N
to	N	N
research	N	C
fares	N	C
by	N	N
time	N	N
and	N	N
location	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
live	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
small	N	N
city	N	N
so	N	N
many	N	N
times	C	N
we	N	N
can	N	N
drive	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
hours	N	N
and	N	N
save	N	N
a	N	N
lot	N	N
of	N	N
money	N	N
by	N	N
flying	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
that	N	N
airport	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
get	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
airport	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
check	N	N
my	N	N
bags	N	N
and	N	N
go	N	N
through	N	N
security	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
passing	N	N
through	N	N
security	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
like	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
my	N	N
email	N	N
,	N	N
talk	N	N
to	N	N
family	N	N
and	N	N
friends	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
do	N	N
some	N	N
reading	N	N
over	N	N
a	N	N
cup	N	N
of	N	N
coffee	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
we	N	N
shut	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
phone	N	N
and	N	N
get	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
love	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
seat	N	N
and	N	N
enjoy	N	C
watching	N	N
the	N	N
clouds	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
below	N	N
us	N	N
as	N	N
we	N	N
are	N	N
flying	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
destination	N	C
.	N	N
	
Upon	C	N
landing	C	C
I	N	N
head	N	N
out	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
next	N	N
destination	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
headed	N	N
to	N	N
visit	N	N
my	N	N
cousin	N	N
in	N	N
Italy	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
weeks	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
week	N	N
before	N	N
,	N	N
my	N	N
dad	N	N
went	N	N
online	N	N
and	N	N
purchased	N	C
me	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
those	N	N
convenient	N	C
e-tickets	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
printed	N	C
it	N	N
out	N	N
and	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
remembered	N	C
to	N	N
bring	N	N
it	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
day	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
flight	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
arrived	N	C
early	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
airport	N	N
so	N	N
that	N	N
i	N	N
could	N	N
go	N	N
through	N	N
all	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
security	N	C
checks	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
off	N	N
my	N	N
shoes	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
belongings	C	C
in	N	N
a	N	N
tray	C	C
as	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
through	N	N
the	N	N
scanner	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
that	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
saw	N	N
the	N	N
board	N	C
with	N	N
all	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
flights	N	N
and	N	N
saw	N	N
that	N	N
my	N	N
flight	N	N
was	N	N
leaving	N	N
soon	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
waited	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
minutes	N	N
by	N	N
the	N	N
gate	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
parents	N	N
until	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
time	N	N
to	N	N
board	N	C

Many	N	N
passengers	N	C
climbed	N	C
aboard	C	C
and	N	N
found	C	N
their	N	N
seats	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
captain	N	N
greeted	N	C
us	N	N
over	N	N
the	N	N
loudspeaker	N	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
the	N	N
plane	N	N

sweet	N	N
young	N	N
girl	N	N
and	N	N
made	N	N
conversation	N	C
while	N	N
ringing	N	C
up	N	N
my	N	N
groceries	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
she	N	N
rung	N	C
up	N	N
and	N	N
scanned	N	C
everything	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
paid	N	N

got	N	N
my	N	N
things	N	N
back	N	N
into	N	N
my	N	N

Then	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
all	N	N
done	N	N
!	N	N
I	N	N
headed	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
car	N	N
to	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
groceries	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
trunk	C	N
and	N	N
return	N	N
the	N	N
buggy	N	C

It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
and	N	N
quick	N	N
grocery	N	C
trip	N	N
.	N	N
	
Today	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
go	N	N
grocery	N	N
shopping	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
a	N	N
list	N	N
detailing	N	C
what	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
buy	N	N
,	N	N
then	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
discount	N	C
grocery	N	N
store	N	N
where	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
get	N	N
everything	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
list	N	N
in	N	N
one	N	N
stop	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
drove	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
parked	N	C
near	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
basket	N	C
and	N	N
went	N	N
inside	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
first	N	N
thing	N	N
I	N	N
saw	N	N
was	N	N
the	N	N
muffins	N	C
that	N	N
were	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
list	N	N
.	N	N
	
They	N	N
were	N	N
by	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
door	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
picked	N	N
some	N	N
out	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
them	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
basket	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
also	N	N
needed	N	N
peanut	N	C
butter	N	N
,	N	N
which	N	N
was	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
and	N	N
chose	N	N
my	N	N
favorite	N	N
peanut	N	C
butter	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
last	N	N
thing	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
was	N	N
bread	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
middle	C	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
looking	N	N
down	N	N
each	N	N
aisle	N	C
to	N	N
see	N	N
if	N	N
I	N	N
saw	N	N
anything	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
forgot	N	N
to	N	N
put	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
list	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
did	N	N
n't	N	N
see	N	N
anything	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
resist	C	C
the	N	N
temptation	C	C
to	N	N
buy	N	N
some	N	N
ice	N	N
cream	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
picked	N	N
out	N	N
a	N	N
loaf	C	C
of	N	N
bread	N	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
stand	N	N
in	N	N
line	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
busy	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
a	N	N
new	N	N
line	N	N
was	N	N
just	N	N
opening	C	N
up	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
able	C	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
near	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
line	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
cashier	N	C
rang	N	N
me	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
paid	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
debit	C	C
card	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
groceries	N	C
in	N	N
a	N	N
paper	N	N
bag	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
left	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
and	N	N
drove	N	N
home	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
previous	N	C
night	N	N
and	N	N
this	N	N
morning	N	N
before	N	N
work	N	N
I	N	N
noticed	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
missing	N	N
a	N	N
lot	N	N
of	N	N
necessary	N	N
ingredients	N	C
for	N	N
my	N	N
future	N	N
meals	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
planned	N	N
out	N	N
a	N	N
trip	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
grocery	N	N
store	N	N
immediately	N	N
after	N	N
work	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
I	N	N
finished	N	N
working	N	N
I	N	N
drove	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
crowded	N	C
but	N	N
not	N	N
too	N	N
hard	N	N
to	N	N
find	N	N
a	N	N
parking	N	N
spot	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
inside	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
the	N	N
nearest	N	N
shopping	N	N
cart	N	C
and	N	N
smiled	N	N
as	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
grocery	N	C
workers	N	N
welcomed	N	C
me	N	N
in	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
inside	N	N
and	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
everyone	N	N
's	N	N
way	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
thought	N	N
about	N	N
what	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
.	N	N
	
Since	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
n't	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
list	N	N
written	N	N
down	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
took	N	N
me	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
came	N	N
up	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
list	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
head	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
started	N	N
to	N	N
map	N	C
out	N	N
a	N	N
route	N	C
in	N	N
my	N	N
head	N	N
that	N	N
would	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
least	N	N
amount	N	N
of	N	N
time	N	N
for	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
follow	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
picked	N	N
up	N	N
my	N	N
deli	N	N
.	N	N
	
They	N	N
offered	N	N
me	N	N
some	N	N
free	N	N
samples	N	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
meat	N	N
I	N	N
asked	N	N
for	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
picked	N	N
up	N	N
my	N	N
bread	N	N
which	N	N
was	N	N
right	N	N
nearby	N	C
.	N	N
	
At	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
wall	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
meat	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
going	N	N
to	N	N
cook	N	N
tonight	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
that	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
extra	N	N
items	N	C
that	N	N
I	N	N
thought	N	N
might	N	N
also	N	N
be	N	N
nice	N	N
later	N	N
this	N	N
week	N	N
while	N	N
heading	C	N
towards	N	N
checkout	N	C

Luckily	N	C
,	N	N
there	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
a	N	N
line	N	N
and	N	N
this	N	N
was	N	N
done	N	N
quickly	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
paid	N	N

packed	C	C

into	N	N
my	N	N
car	N	N

and	N	N
headed	N	N
home	N	N

I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
corner	N	C
market	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
list	N	N
of	N	N

wheeled	N	C
it	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
aisles	N	C

I	N	N
started	N	N
at	N	N
aisle	N	C
one	N	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
through	N	N
each	N	N
one	N	N
in	N	N

to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
everything	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N

Fruit	N	N

vegetables	N	N
were	N	N
placed	N	N
in	N	N
flimsy	N	C
plastic	N	C
bags	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N

provided	N	N

and	N	N
placed	N	N
them	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
cart	N	N
's	N	N
basket	N	N
so	N	N
they	N	N
would	N	N
n't	N	N
get	N	N
broken	N	N
.	N	N
	
All	N	N
other	N	N

were	N	N
tossed	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
cart	N	C

After	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
everything	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N

I	N	N
rolled	N	N
the	N	N

the	N	N

He	N	N

Being	N	N

We	N	N

it	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N

Then	N	N
I	N	N

some	N	N
groceries	N	C

I	N	N
drove	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
supermarket	N	C
and	N	N
parked	N	C
my	N	N
car	N	N

I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
shopping	N	N
cart	N	C
from	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
and	N	N
walked	N	N
through	N	N
the	N	N
big	N	N
sliding	N	C
doors	N	N

It	N	N
's	N	N

of	N	N
food	N	N
there	N	N
are	N	N

Luckily	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
made	N	N
a	N	N
shopping	N	N
list	N	N
before	N	N
I	N	N
left	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
knew	N	N
exactly	N	N
what	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
through	N	N
the	N	N
produce	N	C
section	N	N
and	N	N
picked	N	N
out	N	N
some	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
best	N	N
fruits	N	N
and	N	N
vegetables	N	N

I	N	N
picked	N	N
up	N	N
a	N	N
gallon	N	C
of	N	N
milk	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
dairy	C	C
section	N	N
.	N	N
	
Up	N	N
ahead	N	N
was	N	N
the	N	N
bakery	C	C
and	N	N
some	N	N
fresh	N	N
bread	N	N
.	N	N
	
Down	N	N
the	N	N
middle	C	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
able	C	N
to	N	N
pick	N	N
up	N	N
some	N	N

flour	N	C

and	N	N
other	N	N
baking	N	C

I	N	N
needed	N	N
some	N	N
cereal	N	C
for	N	N
breakfast	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
looked	N	N
around	N	N
until	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
that	N	N
aisle	N	C
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
cart	N	C
was	N	N
just	N	N
about	N	N
full	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
everything	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
headed	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
checkout	N	C
and	N	N
put	N	N
all	N	N
my	N	N
groceries	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
counter	C	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
cashier	N	C
scanned	N	C
each	N	N
thing	N	N
and	N	N
added	N	N
up	N	N
my	N	N
total	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
handed	N	N
him	N	N
my	N	N
money	N	N
,	N	N
helped	N	N
him	N	N
bag	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
groceries	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
headed	N	N
out	N	N

I	N	N
loaded	N	C
up	N	N
the	N	N
bags	N	N
into	N	N
my	N	N
car	N	N
,	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
cart	N	C
back	N	N
up	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
headed	N	N
home	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
food	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
local	N	N
market	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
parked	N	C
the	N	N
car	N	N
and	N	N
walked	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N

I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
cart	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
way	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
inside	N	N
i	N	N
vowed	N	C
to	N	N
stick	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
outside	N	N
edges	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N

I	N	N

some	N	N
fresh	N	N
baked	N	N

also	N	N
got	N	N
milk	N	N
and	N	N
eggs	N	N
and	N	N
cheese	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
caved	N	C
and	N	N
bought	N	N
some	N	N
tortilla	N	C
chips	N	N
because	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
mean	N	N
craving	C	C
for	N	N
nachos	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
also	N	N
checked	N	N
the	N	N
frozen	N	C
aisle	N	C
for	N	N
cheese	N	N
taquitos	N	C

I	N	N
found	C	N

years	N	N
ago	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
had	N	N
never	N	N
seen	N	N

again	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
always	N	N
check	N	N

vain	C	C
,	N	N
hoping	N	N
one	N	N
day	N	N

see	N	N

the	N	N
chicken	N	N

After	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
all	N	N

I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
check	N	N
out	N	N
line	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
small	N	N
talk	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
cashier	N	C
after	N	N
I	N	N
loaded	N	C
my	N	N

Then	N	N
I	N	N
left	N	N

Once	N	N

Before	N	N
I	N	N
left	N	N
the	N	N
house	N	N
my	N	N
wife	N	N
gave	N	N
me	N	N
a	N	N
list	N	N
of	N	N
things	N	N
that	N	N
we	N	N
needed	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
my	N	N
shopping	N	N
cart	N	C
and	N	N
the	N	N
list	N	N
and	N	N
started	N	N
walking	N	N

the	N	N
supermarket	N	C
that	N	N
was	N	N
2	N	N
blocks	N	N

When	N	N

crossed	N	C
them	N	N

When	N	N

have	N	N
anyone	N	N

I	N	N
gave	N	N
her	N	N

take	N	N
a	N	N
trip	N	N

After	N	N

The	N	N

She	N	N

I	N	N
was	N	N
ready	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N

Yesterday	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
haircut	N	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
walked	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
salon	C	C
,	N	N
a	N	N
lady	N	N
named	N	N
Sara	N	N
came	N	N
over	N	N
and	N	N
told	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
follow	N	N
her	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
shampoo	N	C
station	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
sat	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
chair	N	N
and	N	N
another	N	N
lady	N	N
named	N	N
Marsha	N	N
washed	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
towel	N	N
around	N	N
my	N	N
head	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
then	N	N
took	N	N
me	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
Sara	N	N
who	N	N
asked	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
sit	N	N
in	N	N
her	N	N
chair	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
cape	N	C
around	N	N
my	N	N
neck	N	N
.	N	N
	
Next	N	N
Sara	N	N
asked	N	N
me	N	N
how	N	N
short	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
told	N	N
her	N	N
I	N	N
still	N	N
wanted	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
past	N	N
my	N	N
shoulders	N	N
,	N	N
therefore	N	C
,	N	N
she	N	N
should	N	N
only	N	N
cut	N	N
off	N	N
about	N	N
1	N	N
inch	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
told	N	N
me	N	N
that	N	N
was	N	N
fine	N	N
and	N	N
began	N	N
cutting	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
took	N	N
her	N	N
about	N	N
twenty	N	N
minutes	N	N
to	N	N
cut	N	N
an	N	N
inch	N	N
off	N	N
of	N	N
all	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
she	N	N
cut	N	N
it	N	N
,	N	N
she	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
blow	N	N
dryer	N	C
out	N	N
and	N	N
dried	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
she	N	N
curled	N	C
it	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
curling	N	C
iron	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
looked	N	N
really	N	N
great	N	N
!	N	N
So	N	N
I	N	N
paid	N	N
her	N	N
for	N	N
cutting	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
and	N	N
told	N	N
her	N	N
how	N	N
much	N	N
I	N	N
appreciated	N	C
the	N	N
great	N	N
job	N	N
that	N	N
she	N	N
did	N	N
for	N	N
me	N	N
!	N	N
Yesterday	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
local	N	N
barber	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
told	N	N
him	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
the	N	N
buzz	C	C
cut	N	N
and	N	N
he	N	N
sat	N	N
me	N	N
down	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
barber	N	C
's	N	N
chair	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
plastic	N	C
sheet	N	C
over	N	N
my	N	N
front	N	N
so	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
n't	N	N
get	N	N
hair	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
clothes	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
then	N	N
raised	N	N
the	N	N
chair	N	N
to	N	N
his	N	N
preferred	N	C
height	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
combed	N	C
out	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N

ready	N	N

He	N	N
got	N	N
his	N	N
mechanical	C	C
clippers	N	C
and	N	N
buzzed	N	C
around	N	N
my	N	N
head	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
was	N	N
careful	N	N
not	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
hair	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
eyes	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
sat	N	N
calmly	C	C
as	N	N
he	N	N
made	N	N
his	N	N
way	N	N
around	N	N
my	N	N
head	N	N
and	N	N
tried	N	N
to	N	N
move	N	N
as	N	N
little	N	N
as	N	N
possible	N	N
so	N	N
that	N	N
he	N	N
would	N	N
not	N	N
make	N	N
any	N	N
mistakes	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
every	N	N
few	N	N
minutes	N	N
,	N	N
he	N	N
asked	N	N
what	N	N
I	N	N
thought	N	N
about	N	N
the	N	N
progress	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
gave	N	N
him	N	N
some	N	N
additional	C	C
input	C	C
as	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
type	N	N
of	N	N
style	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
and	N	N
he	N	N
gladly	N	C
obliged	N	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
was	N	N
cut	N	N
,	N	N
he	N	N
gave	N	N
me	N	N
a	N	N
mirror	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
head	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
quite	N	N
satisfied	N	C

He	N	N
brushed	N	N
away	N	N
all	N	N
remaining	C	N
cut	N	N
hair	N	N
,	N	N
took	N	N
away	N	N
the	N	N

lowered	N	C

One	N	N

I	N	N
made	N	N
an	N	N
appointment	N	C
with	N	N

I	N	N

told	N	N
him	N	N
of	N	N

He	N	N
started	N	N
by	N	N
washing	N	N
and	N	N
conditioning	N	C
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
sat	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
chair	N	N
that	N	N
leaned	N	C
backwards	N	C
so	N	N
my	N	N
head	N	N
would	N	N
go	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
sink	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
water	N	N
was	N	N
warm	N	N

When	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
done	N	N
,	N	N
he	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
big	N	N
black	N	N
cape	N	C
around	N	N
my	N	N
neck	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
me	N	N

of	N	N
a	N	N

He	N	N
combed	N	C
my	N	N
hair	N	N
straight	N	N
,	N	N
put	N	N
it	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
ponytail	N	C
,	N	N
then	N	N
cut	N	N
off	N	N
just	N	N
over	N	N
1	N	N
foot	N	N

my	N	N
hair	N	N

After	N	N
he	N	N
cut	N	N
it	N	N

my	N	N

,	N	N
dried	N	N
it	N	N

and	N	N
styled	N	C
it	N	N

I	N	N
looked	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
mirror	N	N

smiled	N	N
,	N	N
knowing	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
helping	N	N
someone	N	N
else	N	N

Carla	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
her	N	N
hair	N	N
cut	N	N
today	N	N
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
,	N	N
she	N	N
stopped	N	N
by	N	N
a	N	N
nearby	N	C
hair	N	N
salon	C	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
saying	C	N
hello	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
hairdresser	N	C
and	N	N
waiting	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
minutes	N	N
,	N	N
she	N	N
sat	N	N
on	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
chairs	N	N
that	N	N
were	N	N
now	N	N
free	N	N

The	N	N
hairdresser	N	C
next	N	N
washed	N	N
Carla	N	N
's	N	N
hair	N	N
with	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
shampoo	N	C

Once	N	N
the	N	N
hair	N	N
was	N	N
dry	N	N
,	N	N
she	N	N
inspected	N	C
Carla	N	N
's	N	N
face	N	N
shape	N	N
and	N	N
asked	N	N
what	N	N
kind	N	N
of	N	N
hair	N	N
style	N	N
she	N	N
wanted	N	N
.	N	N
	
They	N	N
discussed	N	C
this	N	N
for	N	N
about	N	N
a	N	N
minute	N	N
before	N	N
a	N	N
decision	N	C
was	N	N
made	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
hairdresser	N	C
then	N	N
prepared	N	C
the	N	N
hair	N	N
,	N	N
separating	N	C
it	N	N
into	N	N
different	N	N
sections	N	C
before	N	N
she	N	N
began	N	N
cutting	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
worked	N	N
calmly	C	C
and	N	N
carefully	N	N
,	N	N
making	N	N
sure	N	N
that	N	N
she	N	N
would	N	N

So	N	N

she	N	N
made	N	N
last-minute	C	C

The	N	N

she	N	N
got	N	N
to	N	N

While	N	N
she	N	N

my	N	N
hair	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
watched	N	N
her	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
mirror	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
facing	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
made	N	N

me	N	N
and	N	N
we	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N

When	N	N
she	N	N
was	N	N

she	N	N
asked	N	N

if	N	N
I	N	N

I	N	N
was	N	N

so	N	N
I	N	N
said	N	N
thank	N	N

told	N	N
her	N	N
it	N	N
looked	N	N
even	N	N
better	N	N
than	N	N
I	N	N
'd	N	N
expected	C	N
it	N	N
would	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
lady	N	N
then	N	N
showed	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
register	N	C
,	N	N
where	N	N
I	N	N
paid	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N

and	N	N
gave	N	N
the	N	N
hairdresser	N	C
a	N	N
generous	N	C
tip	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
had	N	N
been	N	N
a	N	N
while	N	N
since	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
gotten	N	N
a	N	N
hair	N	N
cut	N	N
and	N	N
decided	N	C
it	N	N
was	N	N
time	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
number	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
salon	C	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
phone	N	N
book	N	N
and	N	N
called	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
an	N	N
appointment	N	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
drove	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
salon	C	C
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
favorite	N	N
stylist	N	C
was	N	N
there	N	N
and	N	N
she	N	N
greeted	N	C
me	N	N
and	N	N
had	N	N
me	N	N
sit	N	N
down	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
chair	N	N
that	N	N
was	N	N
in	N	N
her	N	N
booth	N	C
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
wrapped	N	C
a	N	N
plastic	N	C
protector	N	C
over	N	N
me	N	N
and	N	N
bent	N	C
the	N	N
chair	N	N
back	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
she	N	N
shampooed	N	C
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
she	N	N
combed	N	C
my	N	N
hair	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
it	N	N
ready	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
cut	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
she	N	N
started	N	N
cutting	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
special	N	N
pair	N	N
of	N	N
scissors	N	C
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
took	N	N
her	N	N
time	N	N
about	N	N
cutting	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
she	N	N
was	N	N
all	N	N
done	N	N
she	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
hair	N	N
dryer	N	C
and	N	N
dried	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
thanked	N	C
her	N	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
counter	C	N
to	N	N
pay	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
paid	N	N
,	N	N
left	N	N
the	N	N
shop	N	N
and	N	N
drove	N	N
home	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
hair	N	N
had	N	N
become	N	N
very	N	N
long	N	N
and	N	N
shaggy	N	C
looking	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
out	N	N
and	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
haircut	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
go	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
Hair	N	N
Cuttery	N	C
because	N	N
it	N	N
is	N	N
near	N	N
my	N	N
home	N	N
and	N	N
they	N	N
always	N	N
do	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
job	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
in	N	N
and	N	N
told	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
desk	N	N
receptionist	N	C
that	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
like	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
shampoo	N	C
,	N	N
cut	N	N
and	N	N
blowdry	N	C
.	N	N
	
They	N	N
took	N	N
me	N	N
right	N	N
away	N	N
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
the	N	N
attendant	N	C
shampooed	N	C
my	N	N
hair	N	N
and	N	N
escorted	N	C
me	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
stylist	N	C
's	N	N
chair	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
stylist	N	C
asked	N	N
me	N	N
how	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
like	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
cut	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
told	N	N
her	N	N
just	N	N
to	N	N
trim	N	C
the	N	N
ends	N	N
and	N	N
shape	N	N
the	N	N
bangs	N	C
and	N	N
sides	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
bit	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
combed	N	C
through	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
,	N	N
clipping	N	C
up	N	N
sections	N	C
at	N	N
a	N	N
time	N	N
to	N	N
keep	N	N
them	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
way	N	N
while	N	N
she	N	N
cut	N	N
the	N	N
rest	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
work	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
she	N	N
finished	N	N
she	N	N
blow	N	C
dried	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
style	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
thanked	N	C
her	N	N
and	N	N
after	N	N
I	N	N
paid	N	N
I	N	N
left	N	N
her	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
tip	N	C
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
hair	N	N
had	N	N
gotten	N	N
really	N	N
long	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
haircut	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
downtown	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
barber	N	C
shop	N	N
and	N	N
checked	N	C
in	N	N
.	N	N
	
There	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
people	N	N
ahead	N	N
of	N	N
me	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
wait	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
while	N	N
.	N	N
	
But	N	N
that	N	N
gave	N	N
me	N	N
some	N	N
time	N	N
to	N	N
look	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
books	N	N
to	N	N
pick	N	N
out	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
style	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
my	N	N
turn	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
showed	N	N
the	N	N
barber	N	C
how	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
cut	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
up	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
barber	N	C
chair	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
barber	N	C
put	N	N
a	N	N
paper	N	N
towel	N	N
around	N	N
my	N	N
neck	N	N
so	N	N
the	N	N
hair	N	N
would	N	N
n't	N	N
get	N	N
down	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
shirt	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
put	N	N
an	N	N
apron	N	C
on	N	N
over	N	N
me	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
started	N	N
cutting	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
watched	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
mirror	N	N
as	N	N
bits	N	N
of	N	N
hair	N	N
would	N	N
fall	N	N
down	N	N
as	N	N
he	N	N
cut	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
started	N	N
to	N	N
see	N	N
the	N	N
design	N	C
I	N	N
had	N	N
chosen	N	N
take	N	N
shape	N	N
.	N	N
	
Before	N	N
I	N	N
knew	N	N
it	N	N
,	N	N
he	N	N
was	N	N
brushing	N	C
some	N	N
loose	N	N
hair	N	N
off	N	N
with	N	N
his	N	N
brush	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
all	N	N
done	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
did	N	N
a	N	N
great	N	N
job	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
is	N	N
just	N	N
how	N	N
I	N	N
want	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
Today	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
haircut	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
've	N	N
been	N	N
waiting	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
haircut	N	C
for	N	N
a	N	N
while	N	N
but	N	N
finally	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	C
it	N	N
was	N	N
time	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
barbershop	N	C
near	N	N
my	N	N
house	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
inside	N	N
the	N	N
barbershop	N	C
I	N	N
told	N	N
the	N	N
barber	N	C
that	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
a	N	N
haircut	N	C
and	N	N
took	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
util	N	C
they	N	N
called	N	N
my	N	N
name	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
they	N	N
called	N	N
my	N	N
name	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
and	N	N
sat	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
chair	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
barber	N	C
put	N	N
a	N	N
towel	N	N
over	N	N
me	N	N
so	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
hair	N	N
that	N	N
he	N	N
cuts	N	N
does	N	N
n't	N	N
get	N	N
over	N	N
my	N	N
clothes	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
tell	N	N
him	N	N
what	N	N
kind	N	N
of	N	N
haircut	N	C
I	N	N
want	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
he	N	N
begins	N	N
to	N	N
cut	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
periodically	N	C
asks	N	N
me	N	N
if	N	N
he	N	N
is	N	N
doing	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
job	N	N
throughout	C	C
the	N	N
haircut	N	C
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
am	N	N
happy	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
hair	N	N
that	N	N
he	N	N
is	N	N
cutting	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
reassure	C	C
him	N	N
that	N	N
he	N	N
is	N	N
doing	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
job	N	N
and	N	N
after	N	N
he	N	N
is	N	N
done	N	N
he	N	N
takes	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
towel	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
final	N	N
look	N	N
at	N	N
my	N	N
haircut	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
nod	C	N
my	N	N
head	N	N
,	N	N
pay	N	N
him	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
haircut	N	C
and	N	N
also	N	N
a	N	N
tip	N	N
and	N	N
leave	N	N
the	N	N
barbershop	N	C
after	N	N
that	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
shower	N	N
afterwards	N	C
for	N	N
some	N	N
hair	N	N
that	N	N
happened	N	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
shirt	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
job	N	N
interview	N	C
coming	N	N
up	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
couple	N	N
days	C	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
filling	N	C
out	N	N
so	N	N
many	N	N
applications	N	C
I	N	N
noticed	N	N
that	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
was	N	N
getting	N	N
very	N	N
long	N	N
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
I	N	N
ended	N	N
up	N	N
deciding	N	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
cut	N	N
in	N	N
order	N	N
to	N	N
look	N	N
good	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
upcoming	C	C
interview	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
care	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
early	N	N
afternoon	N	N
and	N	N
drove	N	N
off	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
usual	N	N
barber	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
have	N	N
been	N	N
going	N	N
to	N	N
this	N	N
barber	N	C
for	N	N
the	N	N
last	N	N
5	N	N
years	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
never	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
problem	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
arrived	N	C
for	N	N
the	N	N
appointment	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
sat	N	N
down	N	N
on	N	N

chair	N	N
and	N	N
told	N	N
her	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
the	N	N
usual	N	C
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
asked	N	N
what	N	N
the	N	N
occasion	N	C
was	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
told	N	N
her	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
job	N	N
interview	N	C
in	N	N
a	N	N

She	N	N
wished	N	N

luck	N	N
while	N	N
she	N	N
continued	N	C

After	N	N
some	N	N
conversation	N	C

was	N	N

I	N	N
ended	N	N
up	N	N
paying	N	N
her	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
tip	N	N
considering	C	C
I	N	N
felt	N	N
bad	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
n't	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
hair	N	N

the	N	N
wall	N	N
.	N	N
	
Each	N	N
one	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
customer	N	C
in	N	N
it	N	N
who	N	N
was	N	N
already	N	N
getting	N	N
a	N	N
haircut	N	C
so	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
wait	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
read	N	N
a	N	N
magazine	N	C
for	N	N
about	N	N
five	N	N
minutes	N	N
until	N	N
a	N	N
customer	N	C
paid	N	N
and	N	N
left	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
barber	N	C
called	N	N
me	N	N
over	N	N
,	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
smock	N	C
on	N	N
me	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
asked	N	N
me	N	N
how	N	N
I	N	N
liked	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
cut	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
told	N	N
him	N	N
I	N	N
liked	N	N
it	N	N
short	N	N
all	N	N
over	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
wet	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
down	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
spray	C	C
bottle	N	N
of	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
started	N	N
cutting	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
top	N	N
and	N	N
sides	N	N
with	N	N
scissors	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
he	N	N
had	N	N
thinned	N	C
it	N	N
out	N	N
a	N	N
bit	N	N
,	N	N
he	N	N
shaved	N	C
the	N	N
sides	N	N
and	N	N
back	N	N
with	N	N
electric	N	C
clippers	N	C
.	N	N
	
Finally	N	N
,	N	N
he	N	N
put	N	N
hot	N	N
foam	N	C
on	N	N
my	N	N
neck	N	N
and	N	N
used	N	N
a	N	N
straight	N	N
razor	C	C
to	N	N
shave	N	C
my	N	N
neck	N	N
and	N	N
leave	N	N
a	N	N
clean	N	N
neat	N	C
hairline	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
showed	N	N
me	N	N
how	N	N
it	N	N
looked	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
mirror	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
approved	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
barber	N	C
whipped	N	C
off	N	N
the	N	N
smock	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
paid	N	N
him	N	N
,	N	N
giving	N	N
him	N	N
a	N	N
tip	N	C
as	N	N
well	N	N
.	N	N
	
Now	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
ready	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
big	N	N
date	N	N
!	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
looking	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
mirror	N	N
this	N	N
morning	N	N
and	N	N
noticed	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
had	N	N
gotten	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
control	N	N
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
hair	N	N
cut	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
new	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
area	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
first	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
research	N	C
all	N	N
the	N	N
available	N	N
barber	N	C
shops	N	N
nearby	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
found	C	N
three	N	N
different	N	N
places	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
all	N	N
with	N	N
great	N	N
reviews	N	C
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
the	N	N
closest	N	C
one	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
house	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
there	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
wait	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
4	N	N
people	N	N
currently	C	C
waiting	N	N
before	N	N
I	N	N
arrived	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
started	N	N
looking	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
posters	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
wall	N	N
and	N	N
came	N	N
up	N	N
with	N	N
some	N	N
new	N	N
ideas	N	N
on	N	N
what	N	N
hair	N	N
cut	N	N
style	N	N
I	N	N
think	N	N
would	N	N
look	N	N
best	N	N
on	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
buzz	C	C
cut	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
my	N	N
turn	N	N
I	N	N
told	N	N
the	N	N
barber	N	C

cut	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
trimmed	N	C
my	N	N
hair	N	N
low	N	N
,	N	N
then	N	N
got	N	N
a	N	N
fine-edge	N	C
razor	C	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
my	N	N
hairline	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
out	N	N

barber	N	C

feeling	N	N
like	N	N
a	N	N
new	N	N

Last	N	N

My	N	N
hair	N	N
was	N	N
really	N	N
long	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
it	N	N

My	N	N
mom	N	N
called	N	N

salon	C	C
and	N	N
made	N	N
an	N	N
appointment	N	C
for	N	N
me	N	N

We	N	N
went	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
salon	C	C
and	N	N
the	N	N
receptionist	N	C
asked	N	N
us	N	N

We	N	N
told	N	N
her	N	N

she	N	N
marked	N	C
our	N	N
names	N	N

in	N	N
her	N	N
book	N	N

A	N	N
lady	N	N
came	N	N
and	N	N
took	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
an	N	N
area	N	N
where	N	N
there	N	N
were	N	N
some	N	N
really	N	N
deep	N	N
sinks	N	C
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
told	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
lie	N	N
back	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
neck	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
edge	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
sink	N	N
and	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
falling	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
sink	N	N

She	N	N
washed	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
with	N	N
warm	N	N
water	N	N
and	N	N
some	N	N
nice	N	N
smelling	N	N
shampoo	N	C
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
towel	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
to	N	N
dry	N	N
it	N	N
and	N	N
took	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
special	N	N
chair	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
chair	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
foot	N	N
pump	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
lady	N	N
used	N	N
to	N	N
raise	N	N
the	N	N
chair	N	N
way	N	N
up	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
air	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
up	N	N
high	N	N
enough	N	N
for	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
look	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
mirror	N	N
,	N	N
she	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
cape	N	C
around	N	N
my	N	N
shoulders	N	N
and	N	N
began	N	N
combing	N	C
out	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
took	N	N
out	N	N
some	N	N
scissors	N	C
and	N	N
used	N	N
them	N	N
to	N	N
cut	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
into	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
style	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
surprised	N	N
to	N	N
find	N	N
that	N	N
it	N	N
did	N	N
not	N	N
hurt	N	N
one	N	N
bit	N	N
!	N	N
She	N	N
dried	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
blow	N	C
dryer	N	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
finished	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
happy	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
new	N	N
look	N	N
.	N	N
	
Although	N	N
I	N	N
keep	N	N
my	N	N
head	N	N
mostly	N	N
shaved	N	C
very	N	N
,	N	N
very	N	N
short	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
haircut	N	C
.	N	N
	
Summer	N	N
is	N	N
fast	N	N
approaching	N	C
and	N	N
the	N	N
shorter	N	N
the	N	N
better	N	N
to	N	N
keep	N	N
my	N	N
old	N	N
head	N	N
nice	N	N
and	N	N
cool	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
gathered	N	N
the	N	N
clippers	N	C
,	N	N
towel	N	N
,	N	N
a	N	N
razor	C	C
for	N	N
the	N	N
neck	N	N

and	N	N
awaited	N	C
my	N	N
wife	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
home	N	N
from	N	N
her	N	N
job	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
always	N	N
get	N	N
her	N	N
to	N	N
cut	N	N
my	N	N
hair	N	N
as	N	N
she	N	N
is	N	N
really	N	N
good	N	N
at	N	N
it	N	N
albeit	C	C
a	N	N
tad	N	N
slow	N	N
getting	N	N
it	N	N
done	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
she	N	N
arrived	N	C
she	N	N
smiled	N	N
when	N	N
she	N	N
saw	N	N
the	N	N
tools	N	C
for	N	N
a	N	N
haircut	N	C
gathered	N	C
and	N	N
got	N	N
right	N	N
to	N	N
work	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
placed	N	N
the	N	N
towel	N	C
over	N	N
my	N	N
shoulders	N	N
and	N	N
proceeded	N	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
to	N	N
work	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
clippers	N	C
.	N	N
	
Fine	N	N
pieces	N	N
of	N	N
hair	N	N
fell	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
floor	N	N
as	N	N
she	N	N
ran	N	N
the	N	N
clippers	N	C
over	N	N
my	N	N
head	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
my	N	N
neck	N	N
was	N	N
lathered	N	C
up	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
razor	C	C
used	N	N
to	N	N
shave	N	C
that	N	N
area	N	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
quick	N	N
shower	N	N
later	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
felt	N	N
like	N	N
a	N	N
new	N	N
man	N	N
.	N	N
	
Friday	N	N
was	N	N
Madison	N	N
's	N	N
birthday	N	N
party	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
looked	N	N
my	N	N
best	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
asked	N	N
my	N	N
dad	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
local	N	N
barber	N	C
shop	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
there	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
sat	N	N
down	N	N
and	N	N
saw	N	N
that	N	N
there	N	N
were	N	N
two	N	N
other	N	N
people	N	N
waiting	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
go	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
magazine	N	C
rack	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
magazine	N	C
about	N	N
baseball	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
really	N	N
enjoyed	N	C
all	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
stories	N	N
that	N	N
were	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
magazine	N	C
.	N	N
	
Before	N	N
I	N	N
knew	N	N
it	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
barber	N	C
called	N	N
me	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
chair	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
sat	N	N
down	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
he	N	N
asked	N	N
me	N	N
what	N	N
kind	N	N
of	N	N
haircut	N	C
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
summer	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
crew	N	C
cut	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
started	N	N
off	N	N
by	N	N
using	N	N
the	N	N
electric	N	N
razor	C	C
on	N	N
my	N	N
head	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
that	N	N
,	N	N
he	N	N
got	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
scissors	N	C
in	N	N
order	N	N
to	N	N
cut	N	N
some	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
remaining	C	C
hair	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
he	N	N
finished	N	N
,	N	N
he	N	N
put	N	N
some	N	N
powder	N	C
on	N	N
my	N	N
face	N	N
and	N	N
brushed	N	C
off	N	N
any	N	N
hair	N	N
that	N	N
had	N	N
fallen	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
showed	N	N
me	N	N
the	N	N
haircut	N	C
in	N	N
a	N	N
mirror	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
pleased	N	N

love	N	N
everything	N	N

every	N	N

I	N	N
do	N	N
n't	N	N
have	N	N
enough	N	N
money	N	N

go	N	N
out	N	N
and	N	N
buy	N	N
books	N	N
whenever	N	N

borrow	N	C
books	N	N

Recently	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
and	N	N
just	N	N
browse	C	C
until	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
something	N	N
interesting	N	C

I	N	N
drove	N	N

the	N	N
library	N	C
and	N	N
parked	N	C
close	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N

since	N	N
I	N	N
expected	C	C

authors	N	N

last	N	N

having	N	N

Borrowing	N	C
a	N	N
book	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
is	N	N
a	N	N
big	N	N
responsibility	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
my	N	N
first	N	N
library	N	C

when	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
in	N	N
middle	C	N
school	N	N

I	N	N
could	N	N

Halloween	N	N

My	N	N

The	N	N
library	N	N
also	N	N
had	N	N
some	N	N
others	N	N

I	N	N
sat	N	N
around	N	N
a	N	N
table	N	N
with	N	N
my	N	N
pile	N	C
of	N	N
books	N	N
and	N	N
looked	N	N
through	N	N
them	N	N
.	N	N
	
Finally	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
n't	N	N
resist	C	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
counter	C	N

the	N	N
book	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N

took	N	N
my	N	N
card	N	N
and	N	N
typed	N	N
into	N	N
her	N	N
computer	N	N

checked	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
out	N	N
for	N	N
two	N	N
weeks	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
would	N	N
give	N	N

time	N	N

my	N	N
book	N	N
and	N	N
returned	N	N
it	N	N

The	N	N

to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N

up	N	N

book	N	N
about	N	N
horses	N	N
but	N	N
it	N	N
had	N	N
already	N	N
been	N	N
taken	N	N
home	N	N
by	N	N
someone	N	N
else	N	N
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
she	N	N
looked	N	N
again	N	N
and	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
cool	N	N
book	N	N
about	N	N
basketball	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
went	N	N
with	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
shelf	N	C
and	N	N
helped	N	N
me	N	N
find	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
off	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
shelf	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
it	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
counter	C	N
and	N	N
gave	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
lady	N	N
behind	N	N
the	N	N
desk	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
asked	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
gave	N	N
her	N	N
the	N	N
card	N	N
and	N	N
she	N	N
scanned	N	C
it	N	N
and	N	N
my	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
she	N	N
gave	N	N
me	N	N
a	N	N
slip	N	N
of	N	N
paper	N	N
that	N	N
said	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
bring	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
back	N	N
in	N	N
two	N	N
weeks	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
excited	N	N
to	N	N
leave	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
about	N	N
basketball	N	N
!	N	N
I	N	N
paid	N	N
a	N	N
visit	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
a	N	N
couple	N	N
of	N	N
days	C	N
ago	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
getting	N	N
off	N	N
work	N	N
at	N	N
5pm	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
walked	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
library	N	C
branch	N	C
a	N	N
couple	N	N
of	N	N
blocks	N	N
from	N	N
my	N	N
home	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
looking	N	N
to	N	N
borrow	N	C
a	N	N
novel	N	C
that	N	N
I	N	N
'd	N	N
been	N	N
meaning	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
for	N	N
some	N	N
time	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
there	N	N
at	N	N
around	N	N
6pm	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
first	N	N
logged	N	C
onto	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
computers	N	N
to	N	N
confirm	N	C
that	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
was	N	N
still	N	N
there	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
confirming	N	C
this	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
upstairs	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
fiction	N	C
section	N	N
,	N	N
located	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
second	N	N
floor	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
fiction	N	C
section	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bookshelves	N	C
and	N	N
searched	N	C
for	N	N
the	N	N
novel	N	C
,	N	N
successfully	C	C
finding	N	N
it	N	N
fairly	N	C
quickly	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
walk	N	N
downstairs	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
's	N	N
checkout	N	C
desk	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
placed	N	C
the	N	N
book	N	N
onto	N	N
the	N	N
counter	C	N
and	N	N
also	N	N
took	N	N
my	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
from	N	N
my	N	N
wallet	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
showed	N	N
the	N	N
librarian	N	C
the	N	N
card	N	N
,	N	N
where	N	N
she	N	N
then	N	N
checked	N	C
out	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
after	N	N
scanning	N	C
my	N	N
card	N	N
.	N	N
	
Next	N	N
,	N	N
once	N	N
it	N	N
came	N	N
out	N	N
,	N	N
she	N	N
handed	N	N
me	N	N
a	N	N
receipt	N	C
where	N	N
the	N	N
return	N	N
date	N	N
was	N	N
printed	N	N
on	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
received	N	N
this	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
walked	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
apartment	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
novel	N	C
in	N	N
my	N	N
hand	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
really	N	N
looking	N	N
forward	N	N
to	N	N
reading	N	N
the	N	N
novel	N	C
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
friend	N	N
of	N	N
mine	N	N
told	N	N
me	N	N
about	N	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
she	N	N
liked	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
did	N	N
n't	N	N
want	N	N
to	N	N
buy	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
,	N	N
though	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
first	N	N
got	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
register	N	C
for	N	N
a	N	N
library	N	N
card	N	N
because	N	N
you	N	N
ca	N	N
n't	N	N
check	N	N
out	N	N
books	N	N
without	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
desk	N	N
,	N	N
filled	N	N
out	N	N
a	N	N
form	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
waited	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
lady	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
desk	N	N
made	N	N
my	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
right	N	N
then	N	N
and	N	N
handed	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
asked	N	N
her	N	N
where	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
find	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
looking	N	N
for	N	N
and	N	N
she	N	N
showed	N	N
me	N	N
the	N	N
right	N	N
bookshelves	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
located	N	C
the	N	N
book	N	N
right	N	N
away	N	N
and	N	N
took	N	N
it	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
shelf	N	C
,	N	N
but	N	N
then	N	N
I	N	N
stayed	N	N
to	N	N
look	N	N
around	N	N
for	N	N
more	N	N
books	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
library	N	N
has	N	N
a	N	N
card	N	N
catalog	N	C
where	N	N
you	N	N
can	N	N
look	N	N
up	N	N
any	N	N
book	N	N
you	N	N
want	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
catalog	N	C
will	N	N
tell	N	N
you	N	N
which	N	N
shelf	N	C
to	N	N
go	N	N
to	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
used	N	N
the	N	N
card	N	N
catalog	N	C
to	N	N
find	N	N
two	N	N
more	N	N
books	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
took	N	N
all	N	N
my	N	N
books	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
desk	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
them	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
lady	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
desk	N	N
scanned	N	C
a	N	N
bar	N	N
code	C	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
and	N	N
that	N	N
registered	N	C
them	N	N
as	N	N
checked	N	C
out	N	N
to	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
told	N	N
me	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
have	N	N
four	N	N
weeks	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
them	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
she	N	N
was	N	N
finished	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
picked	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
books	N	N
and	N	N
left	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
learn	N	N
about	N	N
gardening	C	C
and	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
sure	N	N
where	N	N
to	N	N
start	N	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
friend	N	N
of	N	N
mine	N	N
recommended	N	C
a	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
it	N	N
out	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
local	N	N
library	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
.	N	N
	
Inside	N	N
there	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
computer	N	N
to	N	N
look	N	N
up	N	N
where	N	N
books	N	N
are	N	N
located	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
typed	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
name	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
looking	N	N
for	N	N
and	N	N
it	N	N
showed	N	N
me	N	N
the	N	N
call	N	N
number	N	N
,	N	N
a	N	N
unique	C	C
number	N	N
used	N	N
to	N	N
tell	N	N
where	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
is	N	N
located	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
wrote	N	N
the	N	N
call	N	N
number	N	N
down	N	N
and	N	N
looked	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
stacks	N	C
of	N	N
books	N	N
.	N	N
	
Each	N	N
stack	N	C
had	N	N
a	N	N
range	N	C
of	N	N
numbers	N	N
printed	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
card	N	N
taped	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
side	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
bookshelf	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
looked	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
call	N	N
number	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
printed	N	N
cards	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
side	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
bookshelves	N	C
,	N	N
then	N	N
searched	N	C
the	N	N
books	N	N
until	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
one	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
looking	N	N
for	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
brought	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
librarian	N	C
took	N	N
my	N	N
library	N	N
card	N	N
and	N	N
scanned	N	C
it	N	N
and	N	N
my	N	N
book	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
special	N	N
scanner	N	C
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
gave	N	N
me	N	N
a	N	N
piece	N	N
of	N	N
paper	N	N
inside	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
that	N	N
said	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
bring	N	N
it	N	N
back	N	N
within	N	N
2	N	N
weeks	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
brought	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
home	N	N
and	N	N
read	N	N
it	N	N
,	N	N
then	N	N
brought	N	N
it	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
librarian	N	C
.	N	N
	
Yesterday	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
to	N	N
see	N	N
if	N	N
they	N	N
had	N	N
the	N	N
new	N	N
Stephen	N	N
King	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
thought	N	N
it	N	N
might	N	N
be	N	N
already	N	N
checked	N	N
out	N	N
,	N	N
or	N	N
maybe	N	N
they	N	N
did	N	N
n't	N	N
have	N	N
it	N	N
yet	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
before	N	N
I	N	N
spent	N	N
the	N	N
money	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
hard-cover	N	C
copy	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
stopped	N	N
inside	N	N
the	N	N
doors	N	N
and	N	N
looked	N	N
around	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
seconds	N	N
and	N	N
just	N	N
took	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
sights	N	C
..	N	N
.	N	N
	
the	N	N
library	N	N
is	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
favorite	N	N
places	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
card	N	N
catalog	N	C
and	N	N
looked	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
and	N	N
,	N	N
sure	N	N
enough	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
had	N	N
two	N	N
copies	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
shelves	N	C
that	N	N
had	N	N
the	N	N
Stephen	N	N
King	N	N
books	N	N
and	N	N
,	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
great	N	N
surprise	N	N
and	N	N
pleasure	N	N
,	N	N
there	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
librarian	N	C
there	N	N
re-shelving	N	C
books	N	N
and	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
books	N	N
in	N	N
her	N	N
hand	N	N
was	N	N
the	N	N
new	N	N
Stephen	N	N
King	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
asked	N	N
her	N	N
if	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
have	N	N
it	N	N
and	N	N
after	N	N
she	N	N
handed	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
me	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
straight	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
check-out	N	C
desk	N	N
,	N	N
paid	N	N
a	N	N
twenty-five	N	N
cent	N	N
fine	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
from	N	N
an	N	N
overdue	N	C
book	N	N
several	N	N
weeks	N	N
before	N	N
and	N	N
checked	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
could	N	N
n't	N	N
wait	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
home	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
Why	N	N
buy	N	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
when	N	N
you	N	N
can	N	N
borrow	N	C
one	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
?	N	N
Your	N	N
local	N	N
library	N	N
has	N	N
a	N	N
wealth	C	C
of	N	N
resources	N	C
just	N	N
waiting	N	N
for	N	N
you	N	N
to	N	N
explore	N	C
.	N	N
	
Before	N	N
you	N	N
check	N	N
anything	N	N
out	N	N
,	N	N
you	N	N
will	N	N
need	N	N
a	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
.	N	N
	
Typically	N	C
,	N	N
you	N	N
will	N	N
need	N	N
to	N	N
prove	N	C
who	N	N
you	N	N
are	N	N
and	N	N
where	N	N
you	N	N
live	N	N
.	N	N
	
Your	N	N
drivers	N	N
license	N	C
will	N	N
probably	N	N
work	N	N
for	N	N
that	N	N
.	N	N
	
Go	N	N
to	N	N
your	N	N
local	N	N
library	N	C
and	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
card	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
you	N	N
have	N	N
done	N	N
that	N	N
,	N	N
you	N	N
are	N	N
ready	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
things	N	N
out	N	N
!	N	N
The	N	N
library	N	C
is	N	N
divided	C	C

After	N	N

The	N	N

a	N	N
simple	N	N
library	N	N

I	N	N
walked	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
local	N	N
library	N	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
favorite	N	N
section	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N

had	N	N
my	N	N
favorite	N	N

Once	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
my	N	N

I	N	N
took	N	N
it	N	N

brought	N	N
it	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
check	N	N
outline	C	C

I	N	N
waited	N	N
in	N	N
line	N	N
until	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
my	N	N
turn	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
gave	N	N
the	N	N
librarian	N	C

library	N	N
card	N	N
and	N	N
they	N	N
checked	N	N
it	N	N
out	N	N

I	N	N

and	N	N
a	N	N
date	N	N
to	N	N
return	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N

I	N	N
had	N	N
three	N	N
weeks	N	N
to	N	N
finish	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
before	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
back	N	N
and	N	N
return	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
left	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
,	N	N
the	N	N
security	N	C
checked	N	N
my	N	N

my	N	N

allowed	N	N
me	N	N

The	N	N
library	N	N
has	N	N
so	N	N
many	N	N
books	N	N
to	N	N
choose	N	N
from	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
's	N	N
hard	N	N
to	N	N
decide	N	N
which	N	N
one	N	N
to	N	N
borrow	N	C
.	N	N
	
Looking	N	N
around	N	N
at	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
shelves	N	C
of	N	N
books	N	N

I	N	N

I	N	N
wanted	N	N
an	N	N
adventure	N	C
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
librarian	N	C

to	N	N
help	N	N
me	N	N
look	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
book	N	N
to	N	N
borrow	N	C

I	N	N
decided	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
pirate	N	C
adventure	N	C
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
But	N	N
before	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
borrow	N	C
it	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
.	N	N
	
Again	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
librarian	N	C
was	N	N
very	N	N
helpful	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
walked	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
counter	C	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
she	N	N
helped	N	N
me	N	N
sign	N	N
up	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
.	N	N
	
All	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
do	N	N
was	N	N
tell	N	N
her	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
things	N	N
like	N	N
my	N	N
name	N	N
and	N	N
my	N	N
address	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
my	N	N
very	N	N
own	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
that	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
easy	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
scanned	N	C
my	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
,	N	N
punched	N	C
some	N	N
buttons	N	N
on	N	N
her	N	N
computer	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
was	N	N
mine	N	N
to	N	N
borrow	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
'll	N	N
be	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
bring	N	N
it	N	N
back	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
days	C	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
do	N	N
n't	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
pay	N	N
any	N	N
late	N	N
fees	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
sitting	N	N
at	N	N
home	N	N
thinking	N	N
about	N	N
a	N	N
particular	C	C
book	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
been	N	N
wanting	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
car	N	N
and	N	N
drive	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
I	N	N
parked	N	C
my	N	N
car	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
parking	N	N
lot	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
car	N	N
and	N	N
entered	N	C
the	N	N
library	N	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
inside	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
I	N	N
went	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
stairs	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
second	N	N
floor	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
second	N	N
floor	N	N
I	N	N
browsed	N	C
around	N	N
the	N	N
aisles	N	C
until	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
looking	N	N
for	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
back	N	N
down	N	N
the	N	N
stairs	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
check-out	N	C
counter	C	N
and	N	N
gave	N	N
the	N	N
librarian	N	C
my	N	N
library	N	N
card	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
told	N	N
the	N	N
librarian	N	C
thank	N	N
you	N	N
after	N	N
she	N	N
checked	N	N
out	N	N
my	N	N
book	N	N

She	N	N
handed	N	N
me	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
and	N	N
a	N	N
receipt	N	C
and	N	N
told	N	N
me	N	N
you	N	N
're	N	N
welcome	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
left	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
and	N	N
got	N	N
into	N	N
my	N	N
car	N	N
and	N	N
drove	N	N
home	N	N
were	N	N
I	N	N
began	N	N
reading	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
I	N	N
'd	N	N
been	N	N
wanting	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
five	N	N
year	N	N
old	N	N
son	N	N
loves	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
books	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
today	N	N
we	N	N
both	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
head	N	N
towards	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
to	N	N
pick	N	N
one	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
Before	N	N
leaving	N	N
the	N	N
house	N	N
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
he	N	N
had	N	N
his	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
with	N	N
him	N	N
because	N	N
without	N	N
it	N	N
he	N	N
would	N	N
n't	N	N
be	N	N
able	C	N
to	N	N
borrow	N	C
a	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
we	N	N
entered	N	C
the	N	N
library	N	C
we	N	N
went	N	N
straight	N	N
towards	N	N
the	N	N
kid	N	N
section	N	N
.	N	N
	
There	N	N
were	N	N
thousands	C	C
of	N	N
books	N	N
to	N	N
choose	N	N
from	N	N
and	N	N
he	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
trouble	N	N
making	N	N
up	N	N
his	N	N
mind	N	N
.	N	N
	
Finally	N	N
we	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
about	N	N
the	N	N
different	N	N
type	N	N
of	N	N
sea	N	N
animals	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
ocean	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
excited	N	N
as	N	N
he	N	N
flipped	N	C
through	N	N
the	N	N
pages	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
he	N	N
decided	N	N
this	N	N
was	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
he	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
home	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
make	N	N
our	N	N
way	N	N
towards	N	N
the	N	N
librarian	N	C

She	N	N
greeted	N	C
us	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
friendly	N	C
hello	N	C
and	N	N
asked	N	N
my	N	N
son	N	N
for	N	N
his	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
scanned	N	C
the	N	N
card	N	N
and	N	N
book	N	N
then	N	N
handed	N	N
them	N	N
both	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
son	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
informed	N	C
us	N	N
when	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
was	N	N
due	N	N
back	N	N
and	N	N
we	N	N
both	N	N
thanked	N	C
her	N	N
and	N	N
wished	N	N
her	N	N
a	N	N
pleasant	N	C
day	N	N

I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
my	N	N
library	N	C

me	N	N
before	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C

Then	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
looked	N	N

for	N	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
I	N	N
liked	N	N

n't	N	N
able	C	N
to	N	N
find	N	N
one	N	N
that	N	N
well	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
asked	N	N
a	N	N
librarian	N	C
for	N	N
advice	N	C
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
also	N	N
looked	N	N
in	N	N

asked	N	N
me	N	N
about	N	N
what	N	N

wanted	N	N
so	N	N
she	N	N
could	N	N
suggest	N	C

Finally	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N

I	N	N
liked	N	N

I	N	N
told	N	N

We	N	N
went	N	N
along	N	N

until	N	N
we	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
correct	N	N

then	N	N
started	N	N

me	N	N
a	N	N
receipt	N	C

I	N	N
thanked	N	C
her	N	N

noted	N	C
the	N	N
due	N	N
date	N	N
down	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
calendar	N	C

I	N	N
waited	N	N
too	N	N
long	N	N
to	N	N
start	N	N
working	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
report	N	N
that	N	N
was	N	N
due	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
class	N	N

I	N	N
was	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
hurry	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
some	N	N
research	N	C
material	N	C
for	N	N
the	N	N
assignment	C	C
.	N	N
	
Sadly	C	C
,	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
requirements	N	C
for	N	N
this	N	N
report	N	N
was	N	N
to	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
couple	N	N
citations	N	C
from	N	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
instead	N	C
of	N	N
other	N	N

that	N	N
can	N	N
easily	N	N
be	N	N
found	C	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
internet	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
an	N	N
hour	N	N
of	N	N
searching	N	C
for	N	N
my	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
it	N	N
at	N	N
last	N	N
and	N	N
head	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
I	N	N
arrived	N	C
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
ask	N	N
the	N	N
librarian	N	C
where	N	N
they	N	N
kept	N	N
such	C	N
books	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
while	N	N
since	N	N
I	N	N
have	N	N
been	N	N
in	N	N
there	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
finding	N	N
the	N	N
section	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
carefully	N	C
looked	N	N
through	N	N
the	N	N
books	N	N
that	N	N
caught	N	N
my	N	N
eye	N	N
and	N	N
picked	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
report	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
librarian	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
borrowed	N	C
the	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
But	N	N
not	N	N
without	N	N
paying	N	N
an	N	N
old	N	N
book	N	N
fee	N	C
I	N	N
had	N	N
from	N	N
a	N	N
year	N	N
ago	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
I	N	N
paid	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
walked	N	N
out	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
in	N	N
hand	N	N
ready	N	N
to	N	N
do	N	N
some	N	N
research	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
am	N	N
an	N	N
avid	N	C
reader	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
am	N	N
always	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
lookout	N	C
for	N	N
the	N	N
next	N	N
best	N	N
story	N	N
of	N	N
nonfiction	N	C
!	N	N
My	N	N
buddy	N	N
,	N	N
Frank	N	N
,	N	N
told	N	N
me	N	N
about	N	N
the	N	N
new	N	N
library	N	C
that	N	N
was	N	N
opening	C	N
up	N	N
about	N	N
a	N	N
mile	N	N
away	N	N
from	N	N
my	N	N
house	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
thought	N	N
this	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
great	N	N
opportunity	N	C
to	N	N
be	N	N
able	C	N
to	N	N
borrow	N	C
some	N	N
free	N	N
books	N	N
!	N	N
I	N	N
drove	N	N
down	N	N
and	N	N
was	N	N
in	N	N
awe	C	C
at	N	N
how	N	N
big	N	N
the	N	N
place	N	N
was	N	N
.	N	N
	
As	N	N
I	N	N
stepped	N	N
inside	N	N
and	N	N
began	N	N
to	N	N
browse	C	C
I	N	N
realized	N	N
that	N	N
not	N	N
only	N	N
did	N	N
they	N	N
have	N	N
books	N	N
but	N	N
they	N	N
had	N	N
video	N	N
games	N	N
,	N	N
DVDs	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
music	N	N
you	N	N
could	N	N
rent	N	C
as	N	N
well	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
spending	C	N
about	N	N
half	N	N
an	N	N
hour	N	N
in	N	N
there	N	N
just	N	N
browsing	N	C
I	N	N
finally	N	N
came	N	N
upon	C	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
:	N	N
The	N	N
Hitchhikers	N	C
Guide	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
Galaxy	N	C
!	N	N
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
counter	C	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
nice	N	N
librarian	N	C
said	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
first	N	N
have	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
library	N	N
card	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
rent	N	C
out	N	N
my	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
filled	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
paper	N	N
work	N	N
and	N	N
she	N	N
handed	N	N
me	N	N
a	N	N
shinny	N	C
new	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
!	N	N
I	N	N
rented	N	C
my	N	N
book	N	N
and	N	N
she	N	N
told	N	N
me	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
due	N	N
by	N	N
a	N	N
week	N	N
from	N	N
today	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
back	N	N
home	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
started	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
reading	N	N
adventure	N	C
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
few	N	N
months	N	N
ago	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
out	N	N
a	N	N
couple	N	N
of	N	N
books	N	N
.	N	N
	
Our	N	N
local	N	N
library	N	C
is	N	N
very	N	N
large	N	N
and	N	N
full	N	N
of	N	N
very	N	N
interesting	N	C
books	N	N
,	N	N
magazines	N	N
and	N	N
movies	N	N
.	N	N
	
Before	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
find	N	N
my	N	N
books	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
stopped	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
coffee	N	N
shop	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
ordered	N	N
a	N	N
coffee	N	N
and	N	N
a	N	N
blueberry	N	C
muffin	N	C
so	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
snack	N	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
finished	N	N
my	N	N
snack	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
began	N	N
to	N	N
look	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
books	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
used	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
's	N	N
computer	N	N
to	N	N
find	N	N
the	N	N
location	N	C
of	N	N
each	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
Finding	N	N
the	N	N
books	N	N
only	N	N
took	N	N
me	N	N
about	N	N
10	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
the	N	N
books	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
sat	N	N
down	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
comfortable	N	C
chair	N	N
that	N	N
was	N	N
next	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
lamp	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
began	N	N
reading	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
books	N	N
while	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
drinking	N	N
my	N	N
coffee	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
stayed	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
and	N	N
read	N	N
for	N	N
about	N	N
thirty	N	N
minutes	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
checkout	N	C
to	N	N
check	N	N
out	N	N
my	N	N
books	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
I	N	N
left	N	N
to	N	N
walk	N	N
home	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
borrow	N	C
some	N	N
books	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
and	N	N
started	N	N
looking	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
shelves	N	C
.	N	N
	
There	N	N
were	N	N
so	N	N
many	N	N
good	N	N
books	N	N
that	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
difficult	N	N
to	N	N
pick	N	N
out	N	N
just	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
used	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
's	N	N
computer	N	N
book	N	N
search	N	N
program	N	N
.	N	N
	
Eventually	C	C
I	N	N
chose	N	N
several	N	N
modern	N	N
plays	N	N
,	N	N
a	N	N
biography	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
on	N	N
ancient	N	C
Rome	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
these	N	N
books	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
librarian	N	C
's	N	N
desk	N	N
and	N	N
asked	N	N
if	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
check	N	N
them	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
said	N	N
yes	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
borrow	N	C
the	N	N
books	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
sign	N	N
up	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
filled	N	C
out	N	N
the	N	N
form	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
she	N	N
took	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
she	N	N
made	N	N
my	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
and	N	N
gave	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
With	N	N
this	N	N
accomplished	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
able	C	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
out	N	N
my	N	N
books	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
card	N	N
in	N	N
each	N	N
one	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
date	N	N
stamped	N	C
on	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
was	N	N
the	N	N
date	N	N
the	N	N
books	N	N
were	N	N
due	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
returned	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
promised	N	C
to	N	N
return	N	N
them	N	N
on	N	N
time	N	N
and	N	N
took	N	N
the	N	N
books	N	N
home	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
the	N	N
day	N	N
off	N	N
today	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
relax	N	C
and	N	N
read	N	N
a	N	N
new	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
go	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
and	N	N
check	N	N
one	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
my	N	N
library	N	C
card	N	N
from	N	N
my	N	N
wallet	N	C
and	N	N
walked	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
looked	N	N
around	N	N
some	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
different	N	N
sections	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
and	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
fiction	N	C
section	N	N
that	N	N
looked	N	N
interesting	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
it	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
counter	C	N
and	N	N
handed	N	N
the	N	N
librarian	N	C
the	N	N
book	N	N
and	N	N
my	N	N
library	N	N
card	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
scanned	N	C
the	N	N
book	N	N
and	N	N
my	N	N
card	N	N
,	N	N
told	N	N
me	N	N
when	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
was	N	N
due	N	N
back	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
handed	N	N
the	N	N
card	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
On	N	N
the	N	N
way	N	N
out	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
bookmark	C	C
from	N	N
a	N	N
table	N	N
set	N	N
up	N	N
near	N	N
the	N	N
door	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
home	N	N
and	N	N
began	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
my	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
week	N	N
later	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
done	N	N
reading	N	N
it	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
returned	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	N
and	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
new	N	N
one	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
out	N	N
and	N	N
take	N	N
home	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
love	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
today	N	N
I	N	N
remembered	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
already	N	N
finished	N	N
my	N	N
last	N	N
mystery	N	C
novel	N	C
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
now	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
time	N	N
to	N	N
head	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
library	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
short	N	N
walk	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
one	N	N
I	N	N
enjoyed	N	C
as	N	N
I	N	N
considered	N	C
what	N	N
kind	N	N
of	N	N
stories	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
check	N	N
out	N	N
next	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
dropped	N	N
my	N	N
return	N	C
books	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
slot	C	C
at	N	N
the	N	N
entrance	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
entered	N	C
the	N	N
library	N	N
.	N	N
	
Oh	N	N
how	N	N
I	N	N
love	N	N
the	N	N
smell	N	N
of	N	N
books	N	N
!	N	N
I	N	N
made	N	N
my	N	N
way	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
fiction	N	C
area	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
randomly	C	C
layed	N	C
eyes	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
bindings	N	C
,	N	N
until	N	N
a	N	N
title	N	C
would	N	N
catch	N	N
my	N	N
eye	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
2	N	N
to	N	N
3	N	N
more	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
take	N	N
my	N	N
selections	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
check	N	N
out	N	N
desk	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
librarian	N	C
,	N	N
who	N	N
knows	N	N
me	N	N
well	N	N
,	N	N
smiled	N	N
and	N	N
noted	N	C
the	N	N
books	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
chosen	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
system	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
library	N	N
has	N	N
a	N	N
scanner	N	C
now	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
makes	N	N
the	N	N
check	N	N
out	N	N
process	C	C
so	N	N
much	N	N
faster	N	N
now	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
picked	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
books	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
other	N	N
side	N	N
,	N	N
placed	N	N
them	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
bag	N	N

and	N	N
stepped	N	N
out	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
autumn	N	C
air	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
traveled	N	C

who	N	N
lived	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
hours	N	N
from	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
planned	N	N
to	N	N
stay	N	N
overnight	N	C
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
packed	C	N
a	N	N
suitcase	N	C
to	N	N
take	N	N
with	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
arrived	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
station	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
ticket	N	N
counter	C	N
to	N	N
purchase	C	C
a	N	N
ticket	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
looked	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
schedule	C	C
of	N	N
departing	N	C
trains	N	N
and	N	N
selected	N	C
the	N	N
time	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
leave	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
paid	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	C
and	N	N
waited	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
a	N	N
while	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
time	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
train	N	N
to	N	N
depart	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
with	N	N
other	N	N
passengers	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
carried	N	C
my	N	N
small	N	N
suitcase	N	C
with	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
conductor	C	C
took	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	C
,	N	N
stamped	N	C
it	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
handed	N	N
it	N	N
back	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
seat	N	N
by	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
and	N	N
settled	N	C
in	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
everyone	N	N
was	N	N
aboard	C	C
,	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
announcer	N	C
announced	N	C
that	N	N
we	N	N
'd	N	N
be	N	N
leaving	N	N
the	N	N
station	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
announced	N	C
where	N	N
we	N	N
were	N	N
leaving	N	N
from	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
final	N	N
destination	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
brought	N	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
with	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
some	N	N
snacks	N	C
in	N	N
case	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
hungry	N	N
.	N	N
	
As	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
traveled	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
watched	N	N
the	N	N
scenery	N	C
that	N	N
went	N	N
by	N	N
-	N	N
there	N	N
were	N	N
small	N	N
houses	N	N
and	N	N
fields	N	N
with	N	N
cows	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
enjoyed	N	C
seeing	N	N
places	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
n't	N	N
seen	N	N
before	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
hours	N	N
I	N	N
arrived	N	C
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
friend	N	N
picked	N	N
me	N	N
up	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
station	N	N
and	N	N
we	N	N
drove	N	N
away	N	N
in	N	N
her	N	N
car	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
like	N	N
to	N	N
ride	N	N
on	N	N
trains	N	N
because	N	N
you	N	N
can	N	N
see	N	N
lots	N	N
of	N	N
countryside	N	C
without	N	N
having	N	N
to	N	N
worry	N	N
about	N	N
driving	N	N
.	N	N
	
One	N	N
time	N	N
,	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
lived	N	N
in	N	N
Alaska	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
rode	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
train	N	N
from	N	N
Fairbanks	N	C
to	N	N
Denali	N	N
park	N	N
.	N	N
	
Just	N	N
like	N	N
with	N	N
all	N	N
train	N	N
rides	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
buy	N	N
a	N	N
ticket	N	N
first	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
stand	N	N
in	N	N
line	N	N
to	N	N
wait	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
to	N	N
stop	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
station	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
climbed	N	C
onto	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
and	N	N
picked	N	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
different	N	N
places	N	N
you	N	N
can	N	N
sit	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
train	N	N
are	N	N
called	N	N
cars	N	N
.	N	N
	
You	N	N
do	N	N
n't	N	N
have	N	N
assigned	N	C
seats	N	N
like	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
plane	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
seats	N	N
are	N	N
wide	N	N
for	N	N
more	N	N
than	N	N
one	N	N
person	N	N
to	N	N
sit	N	N
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
picked	N	N
one	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
car	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
and	N	N
sat	N	N
right	N	N
beside	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
started	N	N
moving	C	N
,	N	N
a	N	N
train	N	N
attendant	N	C
walked	N	N
through	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
our	N	N
tickets	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
I	N	N
stood	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
walk	N	N
around	N	N
.	N	N
	
You	N	N
can	N	N
walk	N	N
from	N	N
car	N	N
to	N	N
car	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
train	N	N
and	N	N
can	N	N
even	N	N
go	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
very	N	N
last	N	N
car	N	N
and	N	N
stand	N	N
outside	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
that	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
fun	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
standing	N	N
outside	N	N
while	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
was	N	N
moving	C	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
hung	N	C
onto	N	N
the	N	N
railing	N	C
to	N	N
be	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
safe	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
back	N	N
inside	N	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
dining	N	N
car	N	N
where	N	N
I	N	N
bought	N	N
a	N	N
sandwich	N	C
and	N	N
water	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
ate	N	N
and	N	N
watched	N	N
the	N	N
scenery	N	C
through	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
saw	N	N
lots	N	N
of	N	N
interesting	N	C
things	N	N
including	N	N
a	N	N
moose	N	C
and	N	N
we	N	N
arrived	N	N
at	N	N
Denali	N	N
right	N	N
after	N	N
that	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
bought	N	N
a	N	N
ticket	N	C
for	N	N
a	N	N
train	N	N
ride	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
city	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
station	N	N
at	N	N
least	N	N
15	N	N
minutes	N	N
early	N	N
so	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
not	N	N
miss	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
waiting	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
minutes	N	N
,	N	N
my	N	N
train	N	N
was	N	N
ready	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
boarded	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
lined	N	C
up	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
other	N	N
passengers	N	C
and	N	N
gave	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
lady	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
counter	C	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
all	N	N
boarded	N	C
the	N	N
train	N	N
in	N	N
an	N	N
orderly	N	C
fashion	N	N
and	N	N
waited	N	N
until	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
time	N	N
to	N	N
depart	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
too	N	N
long	N	N
until	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
time	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
quietly	N	N
sat	N	N
by	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
seat	N	N
and	N	N
looked	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
great	N	N
scenery	N	C
outside	N	N
as	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
went	N	N
by	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
would	N	N
have	N	N
never	N	N
seen	N	N
some	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
scenery	N	C
had	N	N
I	N	N
not	N	N
taken	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
.	N	N
	
Before	N	N
I	N	N
knew	N	N
it	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
had	N	N
arrived	N	N
at	N	N
our	N	N
destination	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
city	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
am	N	N
glad	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
this	N	N
time	N	N
because	N	N
I	N	N
enjoyed	N	C
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
Recently	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
traveled	N	C
to	N	N
Southern	N	N
California	N	N
to	N	N
visit	N	N
a	N	N
friend	N	N
of	N	N
mine	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
suggested	N	C
to	N	N
me	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
down	N	N
south	N	N
as	N	N
it	N	N
is	N	N
cheaper	N	C
than	N	N
driving	N	N
and	N	N
flying	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
looked	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
available	N	N
routes	N	C
and	N	N
price	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
internet	N	N
and	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
ticket	N	C
for	N	N
a	N	N
fairly	N	C
cheap	N	C
price	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
purchased	N	C
it	N	N
and	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
excited	N	N
at	N	N
how	N	N
much	N	N
money	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
saving	C	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
packed	C	N
my	N	N
iPad	N	N
and	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
all	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
electronic	N	C
items	N	N
were	N	N
charged	N	C
and	N	N
drove	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
station	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
waited	N	N
about	N	N
30	N	N
minutes	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
and	N	N
carefully	N	C
boarded	N	C
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
stepped	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
that	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
very	N	N
crowded	N	C
and	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
comfortable	N	C
window	N	N
seat	N	N
next	N	N
to	N	N
an	N	N
old	N	N
man	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
stared	N	C
out	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
and	N	N
read	N	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
iPad	N	N
for	N	N
most	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
trip	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
pleasant	N	C
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
we	N	N
arrived	N	C
at	N	N
the	N	N
destination	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
and	N	N
called	N	N
my	N	N
friend	N	N
to	N	N
pick	N	N
me	N	N
up	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
fun	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
excited	N	N
because	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
finally	N	N
going	N	N
to	N	N
visit	N	N
my	N	N
friends	N	N
in	N	N
Long	N	N
Island	N	N
.	N	N
	
Whenever	N	N
I	N	N
thought	N	N
about	N	N
Long	N	N
Island	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
always	N	N
thought	N	N
about	N	N
Great	N	N
Gatsby	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
wonderful	N	N
homes	N	N
that	N	N
surrounded	N	C
that	N	N
area	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
day	N	N
came	N	N
to	N	N
visit	N	N
them	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
boarded	N	C
a	N	N
subway	C	C
train	N	N
to	N	N
Penn	N	N
Station	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
arrived	N	N
at	N	N
Penn	N	N
Station	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
looked	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
machine	N	C
that	N	N
sold	N	N
tickets	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
machine	N	C
and	N	N
bought	N	N
a	N	N
one	N	N
way	N	N
train	N	N
ride	N	N
to	N	N
Montauk	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
costed	N	C
me	N	N
about	N	N
10	N	N
dollars	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
bought	N	N
the	N	N
ticket	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
looked	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
schedule	C	C
board	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
wall	N	N
to	N	N
see	N	N
when	N	N
my	N	N
train	N	N
would	N	N
arrive	N	N
and	N	N
what	N	N
track	N	N
number	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
located	N	C
on	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
said	N	N
that	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
was	N	N
arriving	N	C
in	N	N
2	N	N
minutes	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
track	N	C
number	N	N
was	N	N
16	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
found	C	N
track	N	N
number	N	N
16	N	N
and	N	N
waited	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
to	N	N
arrive	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
it	N	N
did	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
simply	C	C
waited	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
doors	N	N
to	N	N
open	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
seats	N	N
were	N	N
super	N	N
comfortable	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
empty	N	N
seat	N	N
by	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
started	N	N
moving	C	N
,	N	N
a	N	N
conductor	C	C
came	N	N
around	N	N
collecting	N	N
our	N	N
tickets	N	C
.	N	N
	
Someone	N	N
forgot	N	C
to	N	N
buy	N	N
a	N	N
ticket	N	N
and	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
pay	N	N
extra	N	N
money	N	N
to	N	N
buy	N	N
one	N	N
.	N	N
	
Apparently	C	C
,	N	N
tickets	N	C
are	N	N
more	N	N
expensive	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
reached	N	N
my	N	N
destination	N	C
after	N	N
1	N	N
hour	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
finally	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
off	N	N
to	N	N
visit	N	N
my	N	N
friends	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
excited	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
on	N	N
a	N	N
train	N	N
trip	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
ticket	N	C
counter	C	N
and	N	N
gave	N	N
the	N	N
teller	N	C
the	N	N

I	N	N
had	N	N
saved	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N

I	N	N
could	N	N
hardly	N	C
wait	N	N
until	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
finally	N	N
arrived	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
climbed	N	C
aboard	C	C
,	N	N
put	N	N
my	N	N
suitcases	N	C
next	N	N
to	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
other	N	N
people	N	N
's	N	N
suitcases	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
started	N	N
going	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
conductor	C	C
came	N	N
by	N	N
to	N	N
punch	C	C
everyone	N	N
's	N	N
tickets	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
gladly	N	C
handed	N	N
him	N	N
mine	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
punched	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
that	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
get	N	N
some	N	N
lunch	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
lunch	N	N
car	N	N
and	N	N
ordered	N	N
some	N	N
food	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
fun	N	N
to	N	N
eat	N	N
while	N	N
watching	N	N
the	N	N
world	N	N
pass	N	N
by	N	N
through	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
as	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
rolled	N	C
down	N	N
the	N	N
tracks	N	N
.	N	N
	
Before	N	N
I	N	N
knew	N	N
it	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
had	N	N
arrived	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
destination	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
gathered	N	N
up	N	N
my	N	N
things	N	N
,	N	N
grabbed	N	N
my	N	N
suitcase	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
climbed	N	C
down	N	N
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
as	N	N
the	N	N
conductor	C	C
gave	N	N
me	N	N
a	N	N
hand	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
had	N	N
been	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
fun	N	N
trip	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
ca	N	N
n't	N	N
wait	N	N
to	N	N
ride	N	N
again	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
trip	N	N
to	N	N
Washington	N	N
DC	N	N
to	N	N
visit	N	N
the	N	N
monuments	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
quickest	N	N
and	N	N
cheapest	N	C
way	N	N
seemed	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
by	N	N
train	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
purchased	N	C
a	N	N
ticket	N	N
online	N	N
and	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
friend	N	N
drop	N	N
me	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
station	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
station	N	N
I	N	N
gave	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
agent	C	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
and	N	N
sat	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
lobby	C	C
to	N	N
wait	N	N
for	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
arrive	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
arrived	N	C
I	N	N
boarded	N	C
and	N	N
took	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
next	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
window	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
ride	N	N
would	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
hours	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
settled	N	C
in	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
enjoyed	N	C
watching	N	N
the	N	N
countryside	N	C
pass	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
bored	N	C
with	N	N
the	N	N
book	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
bathroom	N	C
I	N	N
could	N	N
n't	N	N
get	N	N
the	N	N
door	N	N
to	N	N
bolt	N	C
shut	N	N
all	N	N
the	N	N
way	N	N
.	N	N
	
the	N	N
train	N	N
braked	N	C
and	N	N
the	N	N
door	N	N
slid	N	C
open	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
stand	N	N
to	N	N
re-shut	N	C
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
passenger	N	C
next	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
restroom	N	C
saw	N	N
my	N	N
butt	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
embarrasing	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
n't	N	N
leave	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
rest	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
ride	N	N
until	N	N
we	N	N
got	N	N
to	N	N
DC	N	N
.	N	N
	
Today	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
visit	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
friends	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
have	N	N
n't	N	N
seen	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
long	N	N
time	N	N
.	N	N
	
They	N	N
just	N	N
moved	N	N
into	N	N
a	N	N
new	N	N
apartment	N	N
and	N	N
they	N	N
invited	N	C
me	N	N
over	N	N
.	N	N
	
They	N	N
gave	N	N
me	N	N
their	N	N
address	N	C
but	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
sure	N	N
how	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
there	N	N
by	N	N
train	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
first	N	N
thing	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
station	N	N
was	N	N
see	N	N
what	N	N
train	N	N
goes	N	N
to	N	N
their	N	N
neighborhood	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
I	N	N
figured	N	N
that	N	N
out	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
enough	N	N
money	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
metro	N	C
card	N	N
to	N	N
pay	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
fare	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
going	N	N
through	N	N
the	N	N
turnstile	N	C
I	N	N
waited	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
platform	N	C
for	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
to	N	N
enter	N	N
the	N	N
station	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
quickly	N	N
found	C	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
since	N	N
not	N	N
to	N	N
many	N	N
people	N	N
were	N	N
on	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
about	N	N
25	N	N
minutes	N	N
I	N	N
finally	N	N
arrived	N	C
at	N	N
the	N	N
stop	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
supposed	N	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
off	N	N
at	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
stairs	N	N
and	N	N
exited	N	C
the	N	N
train	N	N
station	N	N
and	N	N
walked	N	N
2	N	N
blocks	N	N
away	N	N
to	N	N
where	N	N
my	N	N
friend	N	N
lives	N	N
.	N	N
	
He	N	N
was	N	N
happy	N	N
to	N	N
see	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
ordered	N	C
my	N	N
train	N	N
tickets	N	C
a	N	N
couple	N	N
days	C	N
before	N	N
after	N	N
planning	C	N
to	N	N
meet	N	N
up	N	N
with	N	N
family	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
had	N	N
them	N	N
printed	N	C
out	N	N
and	N	N
ready	N	N
to	N	N
use	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
doing	N	N
the	N	N
standard	C	C
morning	N	N
routines	N	C
,	N	N
we	N	N
finally	N	N
arrived	N	N
at	N	N
train	N	N
station	N	N
about	N	N
half	N	N
an	N	N
hour	N	N
early	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
that	N	N
we	N	N
got	N	N
there	N	N
in	N	N
time	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
approached	N	C
the	N	N
clerk	N	C
desk	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
confirmation	C	C
about	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
about	N	N
half	N	N
an	N	N
hour	N	N
later	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
arrived	N	N
very	N	N
shortly	C	N
after	N	N
we	N	N
sat	N	N
down	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
both	N	N
showed	N	N
the	N	N
tickets	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
employee	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
both	N	N
got	N	N
seated	N	C
into	N	N
our	N	N
seats	N	N
with	N	N
our	N	N
luggage	N	C
being	N	N
handled	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
did	N	N
not	N	N
take	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
off	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
we	N	N
were	N	N
on	N	N
our	N	N
way	N	N
.	N	N
	
While	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
ride	N	N
was	N	N
pretty	N	N
uncomfortable	N	C
,	N	N
the	N	N
sights	N	C
was	N	N
enjoyable	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
ride	N	N
took	N	N
about	N	N
a	N	N
couple	N	N
hours	N	N
until	N	N
we	N	N
arrived	N	N
at	N	N
our	N	N
destination	N	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
both	N	N
got	N	N
our	N	N
luggage	N	C
and	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
look	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
schedule	C	C
in	N	N
advance	C	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
knew	N	N
which	N	N
train	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
check	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
a	N	N
day	N	N
early	N	N
to	N	N
purchase	C	C
my	N	N
tickets	N	C
to	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
them	N	N
,	N	N
since	N	N
this	N	N
was	N	N
not	N	N
a	N	N
trip	N	N
I	N	N
made	N	N
every	N	N
day	N	N
.	N	N
	
On	N	N
the	N	N
day	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
trip	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
checked	N	N
the	N	N
schedule	C	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
there	N	N
were	N	N
no	N	N
delays	N	C
or	N	N
cancellations	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
arrive	N	C
at	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
station	N	N
at	N	N
least	N	N
10	N	N
minutes	N	N
early	N	N
,	N	N
with	N	N
all	N	N
my	N	N
bags	N	N
and	N	N
luggage	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
boarded	N	C
the	N	N
train	N	N
and	N	N
greeted	N	C
the	N	N
conductor	C	C
and	N	N
showed	N	N
him	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
picked	N	N
a	N	N
spot	N	N
that	N	N
was	N	N
open	N	N
and	N	N
sat	N	N
down	N	N
quietly	N	N
.	N	N
	
Since	N	N
this	N	N
train	N	N
had	N	N
many	N	N
stops	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
aware	C	C
of	N	N
when	N	N
my	N	N
stop	N	N
was	N	N
coming	N	N
up	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
would	N	N
not	N	N
miss	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
As	N	N
my	N	N
stop	N	N
approached	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
pressed	N	N
the	N	N
stop	N	N
request	N	C
button	N	N
and	N	N
started	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
up	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
stopped	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
wished	N	N
the	N	N
conductor	C	C
a	N	N
nice	N	N
day	N	N
and	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
family	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
train	N	N
in	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
city	N	N
and	N	N
have	N	N
an	N	N
afternoon	N	N
of	N	N
shopping	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
station	N	N
and	N	N
bought	N	N
tickets	N	C
from	N	N
the	N	N
vending	N	C
machine	N	N
there	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
often	N	N
bought	N	N
the	N	N
ten-trip	N	C
ticket	N	C
because	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
bargain	C	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
we	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
wait	N	N
for	N	N
our	N	N
train	N	N
to	N	N
arrive	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
it	N	N
did	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
stepped	N	N
through	N	N
the	N	N
open	N	N
doors	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
car	N	N
,	N	N
stepping	N	N
carefully	N	N
over	N	N
the	N	N
gap	N	C
between	N	N
the	N	N
platform	N	C
and	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
found	C	N
ourselves	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
sister	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
seat	N	N
by	N	N
the	N	N
window	N	N
because	N	N
she	N	N
always	N	N
likes	N	N
to	N	N
watch	N	N
the	N	N
moving	C	N
landscape	N	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
all	N	N
enjoyed	N	C
a	N	N
train	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
sound	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
wheels	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
tracks	N	N
was	N	N
soothing	C	C
and	N	N
the	N	N
rides	N	C
were	N	N
n't	N	N
too	N	N
long	N	N
.	N	N
	
Before	N	N
long	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
conductor	C	C
came	N	N
and	N	N
took	N	N
our	N	N
tickets	N	C
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
polite	N	C
and	N	N
friendly	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
not	N	N
long	N	N
before	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
went	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
tunnel	N	C
and	N	N
we	N	N
knew	N	N
the	N	N
ride	N	N
was	N	N
nearly	N	N
over	N	N
.	N	N
	
Last	N	N
month	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	C
to	N	N
visit	N	N
my	N	N
grandmother	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
lives	N	N
about	N	N
three	N	N
hours	N	N
away	N	N
from	N	N
me	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
do	N	N
not	N	N
own	N	N
a	N	N
car	N	N
.	N	N
	
To	N	N
get	N	N
to	N	N
her	N	N
house	N	N
safely	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
a	N	N
train	N	N
.	N	N
	
Trains	N	N
are	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
affordable	C	C
way	N	N
to	N	N
travel	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
find	N	N
them	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
comfortable	N	C
and	N	N
pleasant	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
my	N	N
computer	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
website	N	N
where	N	N
people	N	N
buy	N	N
train	N	N
tickets	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
chose	N	N
a	N	N
date	N	N
to	N	N
leave	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
booked	N	C
my	N	N
tickets	N	C
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
tickets	N	C
were	N	N
emailed	N	C
to	N	N
me	N	N

The	N	N

Then	N	N
I	N	N

off	N	N

the	N	N
train	N	N

I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
travel	N	N
across	N	N
the	N	N
state	C	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
was	N	N
the	N	N
quickest	N	N
and	N	N
most	N	N
efficient	N	C
way	N	N
to	N	N
do	N	N
that	N	N
as	N	N
my	N	N
car	N	N
is	N	N
unable	N	C
to	N	N
make	N	N
a	N	N
long	N	N
trip	N	N

I	N	N
went	N	N

checked	N	N
the	N	N

A	N	N
friend	N	N
gave	N	N
me	N	N

once	N	N
there	N	N
I	N	N
purchased	N	C
my	N	N

then	N	N
boarded	N	C
the	N	N
train	N	N
when	N	N
it	N	N
arrived	N	N
on	N	N
time	N	N

I	N	N
brought	N	N
my	N	N

did	N	N
not	N	N
need	N	N

check	N	N
any	N	N
other	N	N

The	N	N
train	N	N
ride	N	N
was	N	N
comfortable	N	C
and	N	N
not	N	N
crowded	N	C
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
my	N	N
own	N	N

There	N	N
were	N	N
no	N	N

only	N	N
mature	C	C
adults	N	N

were	N	N
peaceful	N	N

it	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
pleasant	N	N
and	N	N
quiet	N	N
journey	N	C

I	N	N
visited	N	C

dining	N	N
car	N	N

get	N	N
a	N	N
snack	N	C
and	N	N
though	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
expensive	N	C
it	N	N
was	N	N
well	N	N
stocked	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
bought	N	N
a	N	N
coffee	N	N

a	N	N
turkey	N	N
sandwich	N	N

sister	N	N
who	N	N
lives	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
towns	N	N
away	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
because	N	N
it	N	N
is	N	N
cheaper	N	C
than	N	N
putting	N	N
gas	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
car	N	N
.	N	N
	
So	N	N
I	N	N
drove	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
station	N	N
and	N	N
parked	N	C
my	N	N
car	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
parking	N	N
lot	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
cashier	N	C
's	N	N
window	N	N
and	N	N
waited	N	N
in	N	N
line	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
reached	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
line	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
greeted	N	C
the	N	N
cashier	N	C
and	N	N
bought	N	N
a	N	N
train	N	N
ticket	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
walked	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
platform	N	C
and	N	N
waited	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
to	N	N
arrive	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
finally	N	N
arrived	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
and	N	N
located	N	C
my	N	N
seat	N	N
,	N	N
which	N	N
was	N	N
printed	N	C
on	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
sat	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
seat	N	N
and	N	N
took	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
magazine	N	C
that	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
brought	N	N
to	N	N
read	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
ride	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
train	N	N
eventually	C	C
started	N	N
back	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
left	N	N
the	N	N
station	N	N
.	N	N
	
Before	N	N
long	N	N
,	N	N
a	N	N
ticket	N	C
taker	N	C
came	N	N
over	N	N
and	N	N
asked	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	C
to	N	N
verify	C	C
that	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
paid	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
ride	N	N
and	N	N
was	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
correct	N	N
seat	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
greeted	N	C
the	N	N
ticket	N	C
taker	N	C
and	N	N
gave	N	N
him	N	N
my	N	N
ticket	N	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
arrived	N	C
at	N	N
my	N	N
sister	N	N
's	N	N
city	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
off	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
and	N	N
she	N	N
was	N	N
there	N	N
to	N	N
meet	N	N
me	N	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
station	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
nice	N	N
visit	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
friend	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
set	N	N
aside	C	C
a	N	N
date	N	N
that	N	N
we	N	N
could	N	N
meet	N	N
each	N	N
other	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
lives	N	N
in	N	N
another	N	N
area	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
buy	N	N
a	N	N
train	N	N
ticket	N	N
.	N	N
	
Since	N	N
we	N	N
planned	N	N
the	N	N
trip	N	N
early	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
able	C	N
to	N	N
save	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
bit	N	N
of	N	N
money	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
trip	N	N
would	N	N
n't	N	N
be	N	N
for	N	N
another	N	N
two	N	N
weeks	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
bought	N	N
the	N	N
tickets	N	N
online	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
the	N	N
day	N	N
finally	N	N
came	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
a	N	N
cab	N	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
station	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
very	N	N
far	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
,	N	N
inside	N	N
the	N	N
station	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
checked	N	N
the	N	N
displays	N	C
for	N	N
any	N	N
signs	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
train	N	N
being	N	N
late	N	N
.	N	N
	
Today	N	N
,	N	N
there	N	N
were	N	N
n't	N	N
any	N	N
.	N	N
	
About	N	N
fifteen	N	N
minutes	N	N
later	N	N
,	N	N
my	N	N
train	N	N
showed	N	N
up	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
on	N	N
board	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
crowded	N	C
but	N	N
not	N	N
as	N	N
much	N	N
as	N	N
one	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
local	N	N
trains	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
listen	N	N
for	N	N
any	N	N
announcements	N	C
about	N	N
what	N	N
stops	N	N
we	N	N
were	N	N
arriving	N	C
at	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
'd	N	N
know	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
close	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
destination	N	C
.	N	N
	
Finally	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
train	N	N
arrived	N	N
at	N	N
my	N	N
destination	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
met	N	N
my	N	N
friend	N	N
just	N	N
outside	N	N
the	N	N
station	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
family	N	N
recently	N	N
moved	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
new	N	N
home	N	N
with	N	N
a	N	N
bland	C	C
and	N	N
boring	N	C
yard	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
some	N	N
trees	N	N
to	N	N
spice	N	C
up	N	N
the	N	N
place	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
my	N	N
mother	N	N
,	N	N
father	N	N
,	N	N
siblings	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
all	N	N
packed	C	N
ourselves	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
SUV	N	C
and	N	N
drove	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
nearby	N	N
nursery	C	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
looked	N	N
at	N	N
many	N	N
different	N	N
types	N	N
of	N	N
trees	N	N
before	N	N
settling	N	C
on	N	N
the	N	N
apple	N	N
trees	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
bought	N	N
several	N	N
baby	N	N
apple	N	N
trees	N	N
and	N	N
took	N	N
them	N	N
home	N	N
for	N	N
planting	N	C
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
,	N	N
my	N	N
father	N	N
and	N	N
older	N	N
brother	N	N
dug	N	C
large	N	N
holes	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
help	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
they	N	N
said	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
too	N	N
young	N	N
to	N	N
hold	N	N
the	N	N
shovel	N	C
!	N	N
After	N	N
the	N	N
holes	N	N
were	N	N
dug	N	C
,	N	N
the	N	N
apple	N	N
trees	N	N
were	N	N
placed	N	N
inside	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
shoveled	N	C
dirt	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
holes	N	N
to	N	N
fix	N	N
the	N	N
apple	N	N
trees	N	N
in	N	N
place	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
allowed	N	N
to	N	N
help	N	N
with	N	N
that	N	N
,	N	N
thankfully	C	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
all	N	N
that	N	N
,	N	N
our	N	N
baby	N	N
apple	N	N
trees	N	N
were	N	N
planted	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
and	N	N
we	N	N
were	N	N
all	N	N
very	N	N
excited	N	N
to	N	N
see	N	N
what	N	N
they	N	N
would	N	N
look	N	N
like	N	N
as	N	N
they	N	N
grew	N	N
up	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
freshman	N	C
in	N	N
high	N	N
school	N	N
we	N	N
each	N	N
had	N	N
the	N	N
opportunity	N	C
to	N	N
buy	N	N
an	N	N
inexpensive	N	C
tree	N	N
as	N	N
part	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
Arbor	N	C
Day	N	N
holiday	N	N
.	N	N
	
Part	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
proceeds	N	C
for	N	N
the	N	N
purchase	C	C
were	N	N
going	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
more	N	N
trees	N	N
in	N	N
town	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
tree	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
was	N	N
some	N	N
kind	N	N
of	N	N
evergreen	N	C
tree	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
planned	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
it	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
front	N	N
yard	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
asked	N	N
my	N	N
Dad	N	N
where	N	N
it	N	N
'd	N	N
be	N	N
best	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
it	N	N
and	N	N
we	N	N
picked	N	N
a	N	N
spot	N	N
where	N	N
there	N	N
were	N	N
some	N	N
flowers	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
no	N	N
trees	N	N
.	N	N
	
In	N	N
order	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
it	N	N
I	N	N
read	N	N
the	N	N
instructions	N	C
that	N	N
came	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
and	N	N
started	N	N
by	N	N
digging	N	C
a	N	N
hole	N	N
that	N	N
was	N	N
about	N	N
twice	N	N
the	N	N
size	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
root	C	N
ball	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
small	N	N
tree	N	N
so	N	N
this	N	N
was	N	N
not	N	N
a	N	N
big	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
tried	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
shape	N	N
before	N	N
putting	N	N
in	N	N
some	N	N
moss	N	C
and	N	N
fill	N	N
dirt	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
watered	N	C
the	N	N
tree	N	N
that	N	N
day	N	N
and	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
water	N	N
it	N	N
each	N	N
day	N	N
for	N	N
about	N	N
a	N	N
week	N	N
until	N	N
we	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
rain	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
tree	N	N
grew	N	N
and	N	N
became	N	N
quite	N	N
large	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
one	N	N
thing	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
n't	N	N
realize	N	N
is	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
should	N	N
have	N	N
planned	N	N
better	N	N
for	N	N
how	N	N
big	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
was	N	N
going	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
because	N	N
it	N	N
ended	N	N
up	N	N
shadowing	N	C
over	N	N
the	N	N
flower	N	N
planters	N	C
a	N	N
bit	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
am	N	N
an	N	N
avid	N	C
gardener	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
have	N	N
a	N	N
large	N	N
garden	N	C
and	N	N
lots	N	N
of	N	N
flower	N	N
beds	N	N
.	N	N
	
But	N	N
this	N	N
year	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
some	N	N
small	N	N
fruit	N	N
trees	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
garden	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
nursery	C	C
and	N	N
picked	N	N
out	N	N
a	N	N
small	N	N
dwarf	N	C
apple	N	N
tree	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
tree	N	N
was	N	N
young	N	N
and	N	N
was	N	N
basically	C	C
a	N	N
very	N	N
small	N	N
trunk	C	C
with	N	N
two	N	N
branches	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
brought	N	N
it	N	N
home	N	N
and	N	N
read	N	N
the	N	N
instructions	N	C
for	N	N
planting	N	C
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
whole	N	N
I	N	N
needed	N	N
to	N	N
dig	N	C
was	N	N
18	N	N
inches	N	N
across	N	N
and	N	N
1	N	N
foot	N	N
deep	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
used	N	N
my	N	N
garden	N	N
shovel	N	C
to	N	N
break	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
grass	N	N
and	N	N
dig	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
saved	N	N
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
in	N	N
my	N	N
wheelbarrow	N	C
to	N	N
put	N	N
back	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
whole	N	N
when	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
done	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
small	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
whole	N	N
and	N	N
filled	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
with	N	N
water	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
had	N	N
saturated	N	C
the	N	N
earth	N	N
I	N	N
then	N	N
shoveled	N	C
thew	N	N
leftover	N	C
dirt	N	C
back	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
finished	N	N
in	N	N
about	N	N
15	N	N
mintes	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
think	N	N
I	N	N
will	N	N
get	N	N
several	N	N
more	N	N
fruit	N	N
trees	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
easy	N	N
to	N	N
do	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
planted	N	C
a	N	N
tree	N	N
for	N	N
Arbor	N	C
Day	N	N
last	N	N
year	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
first	N	N
thing	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
was	N	N
decide	N	N
where	N	N
I	N	N
want	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
my	N	N
tree	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
chose	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
spot	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
backyard	N	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	C
what	N	N
kind	N	N
of	N	N
tree	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
thought	N	N
a	N	N
shady	N	C
tree	N	N
would	N	N
be	N	N
nice	N	N
in	N	N
that	N	N
spot	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
tree	N	N
place	N	N
called	N	N
a	N	N
nursery	C	C
and	N	N
picked	N	N
out	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
young	N	N
tree	N	N
called	N	N
a	N	N
sapling	N	C
and	N	N
I	N	N
loaded	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
truck	N	N
to	N	N
take	N	N
home	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
at	N	N
home	N	N
again	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
my	N	N
shovel	N	C
and	N	N
dug	N	C
a	N	N
hole	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
right	N	N
spot	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
backyard	N	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
unwrapped	N	C
the	N	N
trees	N	N
roots	C	C
and	N	N
very	N	N
,	N	N
very	N	N
carefully	N	N
place	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
roots	C	N
at	N	N
the	N	N
bottom	N	N
are	N	N
called	N	N
a	N	N
root	C	N
ball	N	N
and	N	N
is	N	N
made	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
roots	C	N
and	N	N
dirt	N	C
that	N	N
protects	N	C
the	N	N

.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
careful	N	N
not	N	N
to	N	N
knock	N	N
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
off	N	N
so	N	N
the	N	N
roots	C	C
would	N	N
n't	N	N
be	N	N
damaged	N	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
the	N	N
root	C	C
ball	N	N
was	N	N
settled	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
was	N	N
standing	N	N
up	N	N
straight	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
filled	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
up	N	N
with	N	N
dirt	N	C
again	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
watered	N	C
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
tree	N	N
is	N	N
healthy	N	N
and	N	N
growing	C	N
because	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
careful	N	C
with	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
Every	N	N
year	N	N
we	N	N
celebrate	N	C
Arbor	N	C
Day	N	N
.	N	N
	
Last	N	N
year	N	N
we	N	N
we	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
celebrate	N	C
the	N	N
holiday	N	N
by	N	N
planing	N	C
a	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
local	N	N
plant	N	N
nursery	C	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
talked	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
employees	N	C
to	N	N
find	N	N
out	N	N
which	N	N
trees	N	N
grow	N	N
well	N	N
in	N	N
our	N	N
area	N	N
and	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
type	N	N
of	N	N
soil	C	C
we	N	N
have	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
chose	N	N
a	N	N
small	N	N
maple	N	C
seedling	N	C
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
we	N	N
got	N	N
home	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
chose	N	N
an	N	N
area	N	N
of	N	N
our	N	N
yard	N	N
with	N	N
lots	N	N
of	N	N
sun	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
dug	N	C
a	N	N
hole	N	N
just	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
bigger	N	N
than	N	N
the	N	N
roots	C	C
of	N	N
our	N	N
seedling	N	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
seedling	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
very	N	N
carefully	N	N
,	N	N
then	N	N
covered	N	N
the	N	N
roots	C	C
with	N	N
dirt	N	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
patted	N	C
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
down	N	N
really	N	N
good	N	N
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
little	N	N
tree	N	N
seedling	N	C
would	N	N
be	N	N
stable	C	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
when	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
windy	N	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
we	N	N
watered	N	C
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
've	N	N
been	N	N
watching	N	N
and	N	N
watering	N	C
our	N	N
tree	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
year	N	N
and	N	N
slowly	N	N
but	N	N
surely	C	C
our	N	N
little	N	N
tree	N	N
is	N	N
growing	C	N
.	N	N
	
If	N	N
you	N	N
want	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
a	N	N
tree	N	N
it	N	N
is	N	N
best	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
a	N	N
small	N	N
sapling	N	C
.	N	N
	
Dig	N	N
yourself	N	N
a	N	N
hole	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
saplings	N	C
root	C	N
ball	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
You	N	N
do	N	N
not	N	N
want	N	N
to	N	N
cut	N	N
or	N	N
break	N	N
the	N	N
roots	C	C
when	N	N
you	N	N
put	N	N
it	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
.	N	N
	
Make	N	N
sure	N	N
your	N	N
hole	N	N
is	N	N
big	N	N
enough	N	N
but	N	N
not	N	N
too	N	N
deep	N	N
.	N	N
	
You	N	N
also	N	N
do	N	N
not	N	N
want	N	N
your	N	N
hole	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
too	N	N
narrow	N	C
.	N	N
	
You	N	N
can	N	N
remove	N	N
any	N	N
dead	N	N
or	N	N
dried	N	N
up	N	N
roots	C	C
from	N	N
the	N	N
ball	N	N
.	N	N
	
You	N	N
now	N	N
want	N	N
to	N	N
refill	N	C
with	N	N
dirt	N	N
lightly	N	C
tamping	N	C
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
as	N	N
you	N	N
go	N	N
.	N	N
	
Make	N	N
a	N	N
mound	N	C
of	N	N
dirt	N	C
around	N	N
the	N	N
base	C	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
that	N	N
no	N	N
longer	N	N
fits	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
Water	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
is	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
idea	N	N
to	N	N
also	N	N
add	N	N
some	N	N
sort	N	N
of	N	N
mulch	N	C
to	N	N
protect	N	N
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
from	N	N
washing	N	N
away	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
will	N	N
also	N	N
help	N	N
keep	N	N
weeds	N	C
from	N	N
growing	C	N
and	N	N
help	N	N
in	N	N
keeping	N	N
moisture	N	C
to	N	N
roots	C	N
.	N	N
	
Fertilize	N	C
and	N	N
water	N	N
your	N	N
newly	C	N
planted	N	C
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
yard	N	N
was	N	N
very	N	N
bare	C	C
and	N	N
plain-looking	N	C
so	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
add	N	N
some	N	N
trees	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
landscape	N	C
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
local	N	N
nursery	C	C
and	N	N
asked	N	N
them	N	N
for	N	N
advice	N	C
on	N	N
what	N	N
kinds	N	N
of	N	N
trees	N	N
would	N	N
do	N	N
well	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
area	N	N
,	N	N
level	N	N
of	N	N
sunlight	C	N
,	N	N
amount	N	N
of	N	N
precipitation	N	C
,	N	N
etc	N	N
.	N	N
	
They	N	N
gave	N	N
me	N	N
some	N	N
ideas	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
picked	N	N
out	N	N
a	N	N
Bradford	N	C
pear	N	C
tree	N	N
sapling	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
took	N	N
it	N	N
home	N	N
and	N	N
left	N	N
it	N	N
in	N	N
shade	N	C
while	N	N
I	N	N
prepared	N	C
to	N	N
plant	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
out	N	N
a	N	N
shovel	N	C
and	N	N
dug	N	C
a	N	N
deep	N	N
enough	N	N
hole	N	N
to	N	N
cover	N	N
the	N	N
whole	N	N
root	C	C
ball	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
placed	N	N
some	N	N
fertilizer	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
bottom	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
Next	N	N
I	N	N
unwrapped	N	C
the	N	N
root	C	C
ball	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
burlap	N	C
sack	C	N
which	N	N
contained	N	C
it	N	N
and	N	N
placed	N	N
it	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
dug	N	C
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
in	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
shoveled	N	C
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
back	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
opening	C	N
and	N	N
tamped	N	C
it	N	N
firmly	C	C
around	N	N
the	N	N
base	C	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
placed	N	N
a	N	N
soaker	N	C
hose	N	C
near	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
give	N	N
it	N	N
plenty	N	N
of	N	N
water	N	N
.	N	N
	
Before	N	N
you	N	N
plant	N	N
a	N	N
tree	N	N
,	N	N
you	N	N
must	N	N
contact	N	N
the	N	N
utility	N	C
company	N	N
.	N	N
	
They	N	N
will	N	N
come	N	N
to	N	N
your	N	N
property	N	N
and	N	N
mark	N	N
out	N	N
utility	N	C
lines	N	N
.	N	N
	
Without	N	N
doing	N	N
this	N	N
,	N	N
you	N	N
may	N	N
dig	N	C
down	N	N
and	N	N
hit	N	N
a	N	N
line	N	N
,	N	N
which	N	N
can	N	N
be	N	N
lethal	C	C
!	N	N
Once	N	N
you	N	N
know	N	N
where	N	N
to	N	N
dig	N	N
,	N	N
select	N	C
what	N	N
type	N	N
of	N	N
tree	N	N
you	N	N
want	N	N
.	N	N
	
Take	N	N
things	N	N
into	N	N
consideration	C	C
such	C	N
as	N	N
how	N	N
much	N	N
sun	N	N
it	N	N
gets	N	N
,	N	N
what	N	N
zone	N	C
you	N	N
are	N	N
in	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
how	N	N
quickly	N	N
you	N	N
want	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
grow	N	N
.	N	N
	
Dig	N	C
a	N	N
hole	N	N
large	N	N
enough	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
and	N	N
roots	C	C
.	N	N
	
Place	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
fill	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
back	N	N
up	N	N
with	N	N
dirt	N	C
.	N	N
	
Many	N	N
small	N	N
trees	N	N
will	N	N
need	N	N
support	N	N
until	N	N
they	N	N
are	N	N
bigger	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
will	N	N
ensure	C	C
they	N	N
grow	N	N
tall	N	N
and	N	N
straight	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
is	N	N
crucial	C	C
to	N	N
keep	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
watered	N	C
!	N	N
It	N	N
will	N	N
need	N	N
a	N	N
lot	N	N
of	N	N
water	N	N
at	N	N
first	N	N
.	N	N
	
Mulch	N	C
is	N	N
helpful	N	N
to	N	N
keep	N	N
the	N	N
soil	C	C
moist	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
's	N	N
also	N	N
important	N	N
to	N	N
wait	N	N
until	N	N
the	N	N
threat	C	C
of	N	N
a	N	N

future	N	N
.	N	N
	
Giving	N	N
care	N	N
to	N	N
your	N	N
new	N	N
tree	N	N
will	N	N
ensure	C	C
that	N	N
it	N	N
will	N	N
grow	N	N
big	N	N

Two	N	N
days	C	N
ago	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
Earth	N	N
Day	N	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
few	N	N
people	N	N
were	N	N
giving	N	N
out	N	N
seeds	N	C
in	N	N
order	N	N
to	N	N
project	N	C
the	N	N
idea	N	N
of	N	N
green	N	N
living	C	N
into	N	N
people	N	N

.	N	N
	
My	N	N
friend	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
,	N	N
Joey	N	N
,	N	N
decided	N	N
that	N	N
we	N	N
would	N	N
help	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
trees	N	N
in	N	N
order	N	N
to	N	N
contribute	C	C
to	N	N
the	N	N
efforts	N	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
received	N	N
a	N	N
few	N	N
tree	N	N
saplings	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
mail	N	N
from	N	N
a	N	N
catalog	N	C
.	N	N
	
Joey	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
that	N	N
we	N	N
would	N	N
plant	N	C
them	N	N
in	N	N
our	N	N
backyard	N	C
to	N	N
provide	N	N
shade	N	C
.	N	N
	
While	N	N
the	N	N
trees	N	N
might	N	N
be	N	N
small	N	N
now	N	N
,	N	N
hopefully	N	N
they	N	N
would	N	N
grow	N	N
into	N	N
big	N	N
trees	N	N
for	N	N
maybe	N	N
our	N	N
kids	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
got	N	N
all	N	N
down	N	N
and	N	N
dirty	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
grass	N	N
,	N	N
starting	N	N
to	N	N
rake	N	C
up	N	N
a	N	N
circle	N	N
of	N	N
grass	N	N
in	N	N
order	N	N
to	N	N
turn	N	N
over	N	N
some	N	N
topsoil	N	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
trowel	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
yes	N	N
we	N	N
called	N	N
it	N	N
a	N	N
trowel	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
we	N	N
dug	N	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
to	N	N
start	N	N
planting	N	C
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
made	N	N
a	N	N
six	N	N
inch	N	N
deep	N	N
hole	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
soil	C	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
put	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
finished	N	N
by	N	N
packing	N	C
the	N	N
soil	C	C
down	N	N
around	N	N
the	N	N
roots	C	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
small	N	N
tree	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
we	N	N
watered	N	C
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
bought	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
flowering	N	C
tree	N	N
at	N	N
a	N	N
local	N	N
greenhouse	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
came	N	N
with	N	N
its	N	N
roots	C	C
bundled	N	C
up	N	N
in	N	N
burlap	N	C
,	N	N
or	N	N
something	N	N
that	N	N
looks	N	N
like	N	N
burlap	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
dug	N	C
a	N	N
hole	N	N
about	N	N
two	N	N
feet	N	N
deep	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
front	N	N
yard	N	N
,	N	N
where	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
to	N	N
grow	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
instructions	N	C
said	N	N
to	N	N
leave	N	N
the	N	N
roots	C	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
bag	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
bag	N	N
would	N	N
naturally	C	C
rot	C	C
away	N	N
with	N	N
time	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
roots	C	C
would	N	N
poke	N	C
out	N	N
of	N	N
it	N	N
as	N	N
they	N	N
grew	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
my	N	N
hole	N	N
was	N	N
dug	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
moved	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
spot	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
it	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
started	N	N
filling	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
I	N	N
'd	N	N
made	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
that	N	N
I	N	N
'd	N	N
dug	N	C
up	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
was	N	N
standing	N	N
straight	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
tamped	N	C
down	N	N
the	N	N
loose	N	N
dirt	N	C
by	N	N
walking	N	N
on	N	N
it	N	N
until	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
seemed	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
firmly	C	C
in	N	N
place	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
put	N	N
some	N	N
mulch	N	C
around	N	N
the	N	N
base	C	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
a	N	N
circle	N	N
.	N	N
	
That	N	N
's	N	N
supposed	N	C
to	N	N
help	N	N
the	N	N
area	N	N
retain	C	C
moisture	N	C
,	N	N
which	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
needs	C	N
to	N	N
survive	C	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
that	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
out	N	N
the	N	N
hose	N	C
and	N	N
watered	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
to	N	N
give	N	N
it	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
start	N	N
in	N	N
life	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
's	N	N
spring	N	N
time	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
a	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
purchased	N	C
a	N	N
small	N	N
orange	N	N
tree	N	N
to	N	N
go	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
yard	N	N
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
I	N	N
dug	N	C
a	N	N
hole	N	N
where	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
shook	N	N
the	N	N
roots	C	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
to	N	N
loosen	C	C
them	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
I	N	N
placed	N	C
the	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
used	N	N
a	N	N
shovel	N	C
to	N	N
replace	N	C
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
back	N	N
over	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
roots	C	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
satisfied	N	C
the	N	N
tree	N	N
was	N	N
firmly	C	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
i	N	N
dragged	N	C
over	N	N
the	N	N
hose	N	C
.	N	N
	
New	N	N
trees	N	N
needs	C	N
lots	N	N
of	N	N
water	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
watered	N	C
the	N	N
tree	N	N
until	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
satisfied	N	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
put	N	N
mulch	N	C
around	N	N
the	N	N
base	C	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
also	N	N
attached	N	C
ropes	N	C
to	N	N
secure	C	C
the	N	N
young	N	N
tree	N	N
so	N	N
it	N	N
would	N	N
n't	N	N
fall	N	N
over	N	N
while	N	N
it	N	N
's	N	N
roots	C	C
were	N	N
still	N	N
settling	N	C
in	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
also	N	N
had	N	N
a	N	N
canval	N	C
funnel	N	C
installed	N	C
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
water	N	N
went	N	N
right	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
roots	C	C
where	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
need	N	N
most	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
all	N	N
was	N	N
said	N	N
and	N	N
done	N	N
i	N	N
stepped	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
admire	N	C
my	N	N
handy	C	C
work	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
did	N	N
my	N	N
research	N	C
and	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
that	N	N
whatever	N	N
tree	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
planting	N	C
could	N	N
survive	C	C
in	N	N
my	N	N
region	N	C
,	N	N
since	N	N
my	N	N
state	C	N
can	N	N
get	N	N
cold	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
checked	N	C
to	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
okay	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
Since	N	N
my	N	N
parents	N	N
were	N	N
the	N	N
land-owners	N	C
,	N	N
they	N	N
said	N	N
yes	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
it	N	N
far	N	N
away	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
house	N	N
and	N	N
any	N	N
piper	N	C
or	N	N
wires	N	C
.	N	N
	
That	N	N
way	N	N
,	N	N
when	N	N
it	N	N
grew	N	N
larger	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
would	N	N
not	N	N
be	N	N
dangerous	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
a	N	N
pine	C	C
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
They	N	N
are	N	N
not	N	N
as	N	N
messy	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
fall	N	N
,	N	N
because	N	N
they	N	N
have	N	N
needles	N	C
that	N	N
they	N	N
keep	N	N
instead	N	C
of	N	N
leaves	N	N
that	N	N
they	N	N
shed	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
bought	N	N
a	N	N
small	N	N
sapling	N	C
at	N	N
a	N	N
store	N	N
.	N	N
	
Growing	C	N
a	N	N
tree	N	N
from	N	N
a	N	N
seed	C	C
is	N	N
more	N	N
difficult	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
dug	N	C
a	N	N
hole	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
wide	N	N
enough	N	N
to	N	N
hold	N	N
the	N	N
roots	C	C
well	N	N
and	N	N
about	N	N
4	N	N
inches	N	N
deep	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
gently	C	C
removed	N	C
the	N	N
tree	N	N
from	N	N
its	N	N
container	C	C
and	N	N
placed	N	N
it	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
covered	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
back	N	N
up	N	N
with	N	N
soil	C	C
and	N	N
watered	N	C
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
Earth	N	N
day	N	N
happens	N	N
every	N	N
year	N	N
on	N	N
April	N	N
22	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
do	N	N
something	N	N
about	N	N
it	N	N
later	N	N
year	N	N
and	N	N
went	N	N
out	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
a	N	N
tree	N	N
this	N	N
year	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
wondered	N	C
over	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
local	N	N
tree	N	N
farm	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
bought	N	N
a	N	N
sapling	N	C
with	N	N
a	N	N
friend	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
both	N	N
borrowed	N	C
a	N	N
friend	N	N
's	N	N
pick	N	N
up	N	N
truck	N	N
and	N	N
drove	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
place	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
woods	N	N
that	N	N
we	N	N
usually	N	N
hang	N	N
out	N	N
at	N	N
.	N	N
	
While	N	N
we	N	N
arrived	N	N
there	N	N
,	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
beautiful	N	N
weather	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
beginning	N	N
of	N	N
Spring	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
went	N	N
off	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
area	N	N
where	N	N
we	N	N
always	N	N
set	N	N
up	N	N
our	N	N
tents	N	C
when	N	N
we	N	N
go	N	N
camping	N	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
ended	N	N
up	N	N
digging	N	C
near	N	N
the	N	N
campsite	N	C
and	N	N
removed	N	C
the	N	N
bag	N	N
around	N	N
the	N	N
sapling	N	C
.	N	N
	
Carefully	N	C
,	N	N
we	N	N
both	N	N
picked	N	N
up	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
and	N	N
placed	N	N
it	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
we	N	N
dug	N	C
and	N	N
it	N	N
fit	N	C
in	N	N
perfectly	N	N
!	N	N
After	N	N
that	N	N
I	N	N
carefully	N	C
held	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
place	N	N
while	N	N
my	N	N
friend	N	N
filled	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
back	N	N
with	N	N
dirt	N	C
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
year	N	N
later	N	N
,	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
is	N	N
still	N	N
growing	C	N
in	N	N
perfect	N	N
health	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
decided	N	N
one	N	N
day	N	N
to	N	N
plant	N	N
a	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
front	N	N
yard	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
was	N	N
unsure	C	C
of	N	N
what	N	N
sort	N	N
of	N	N
tree	N	N
I	N	N
should	N	N
plant	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
online	N	N
and	N	N
did	N	N
research	N	C
as	N	N
to	N	N
which	N	N
type	N	N
of	N	N
tree	N	N
would	N	N
be	N	N
best	N	N
for	N	N
my	N	N
situation	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
settled	N	C
on	N	N
a	N	N
magnificent	N	C
Norway	N	N
Pine	C	N
,	N	N
as	N	N
it	N	N
is	N	N
common	N	N
in	N	N
Northern	N	N
Minnesota	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
went	N	N
out	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
nearest	N	N
greenhouse	N	C
,	N	N
which	N	N
I	N	N
found	C	N
via	N	N
Google	N	N
Maps	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
asked	N	N
them	N	N
where	N	N
they	N	N
kept	N	N
their	N	N
saplings	N	C
-LRB-	N	N
as	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
read	N	N
that	N	N
this	N	N
is	N	N
how	N	N
one	N	N
should	N	N
plant	N	N
a	N	N
tree	N	N
-RRB-	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
got	N	N
the	N	N
sapling	N	C
and	N	N
brought	N	N
it	N	N
home	N	N
with	N	N
me	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
only	N	N
six	N	N
inches	N	N
high	N	N
but	N	N
I	N	N
knew	N	N
I	N	N
could	N	N
make	N	N
it	N	N
grow	N	N
tall	N	N
and	N	N
strong	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
shovel	N	C
and	N	N
started	N	N
to	N	N
dig	N	C
,	N	N
one	N	N
small	N	N
hole	N	N
the	N	N
size	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
pot	N	N
the	N	N
sapling	N	C
was	N	N
in	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
carefully	N	C
took	N	N
the	N	N
sapling	N	C
out	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
pot	N	N
and	N	N
placed	N	N
it	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
freshly	N	N
dug	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
Filling	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
empty	N	N
parts	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
with	N	N
extra	N	N
dirt	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
marveled	N	C
at	N	N
my	N	N
creation	C	C
.	N	N
	
That	N	N
was	N	N
the	N	N
day	N	N
I	N	N
planted	N	C
a	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
front	N	N
yard	N	N
.	N	N
	
Yesterday	N	N
I	N	N
planted	N	C
a	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
I	N	N
went	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
nursery	C	C
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
nursery	C	C
is	N	N
a	N	N
place	N	N
where	N	N
they	N	N
have	N	N
,	N	N
flowers	N	N
,	N	N
plants	N	N
,	N	N
shrubs	N	C
and	N	N
trees	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
chose	N	N
a	N	N
sapling	N	C
-	N	N
a	N	N
young	N	N
tree	N	C
-	N	N
paid	N	N
for	N	N
it	N	N
and	N	N
put	N	N
in	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
pickup	N	C
truck	N	N
.	N	N
	
When	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
home	N	N
I	N	N
got	N	N
a	N	N
shovel	N	C
out	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
shed	C	C
and	N	N
dug	N	C
a	N	N
hole	N	N
where	N	N
I	N	N
wanted	N	N
to	N	N
tree	N	N
to	N	N
grow	N	N
,	N	N
making	N	N
sure	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
too	N	N
near	N	N
my	N	N
house	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
dug	N	C
the	N	N
hole	N	N
about	N	N
two	N	N
feet	N	N
deep	N	N
,	N	N
a	N	N
little	N	N
bigger	N	N
than	N	N
the	N	N
root	C	C
ball	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
bottom	N	N
of	N	N
my	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
dug	N	C
,	N	N
I	N	N
dropped	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
,	N	N
making	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
trunk	C	C
was	N	N
straight	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
cut	N	N
the	N	N
burlap	N	C
surrounding	C	C
the	N	N
root	C	N
ball	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
filled	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
space	N	N
around	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
I	N	N
had	N	N
dug	N	C
out	N	N
earlier	N	N
.	N	N
	
Finally	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
garden	N	N
hose	N	C
and	N	N
watered	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
,	N	N
making	N	N
sure	N	N
to	N	N
give	N	N
it	N	N
a	N	N
good	N	N
soaking	C	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
tree	N	N
should	N	N
give	N	N
us	N	N
pleasure	N	C
for	N	N
years	N	N
to	N	N
come	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
husband	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
love	N	N
trees	N	N
.	N	N
	
In	N	N
the	N	N
spring	N	N
we	N	N
bought	N	N
some	N	N
trees	N	N
from	N	N
a	N	N
catalog	N	C
and	N	N
planted	N	C
them	N	N
in	N	N
May	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
warm	N	N
day	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
sun	N	N
was	N	N
shining	N	C
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
n't	N	N
too	N	N
hot	N	N
because	N	N
there	N	N
was	N	N
a	N	N
cool	N	N
breeze	N	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
went	N	N
out	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
back	N	N
garden	N	N
with	N	N
shovels	N	C
and	N	N
trowels	N	C
,	N	N
gardening	C	C
gloves	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
hose	N	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
each	N	N
dug	N	C
a	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
Mine	N	N
was	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
white	N	N
birch	N	C
I	N	N
had	N	N
picked	N	N
out	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
my	N	N
husband	N	N
's	N	N
was	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
hazel	N	C
tree	N	N
he	N	N
had	N	N
picked	N	N
out	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
laughed	N	N
and	N	N
talked	N	N
as	N	N
we	N	N
worked	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
digging	N	C
went	N	N
quickly	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
soil	C	C
was	N	N
also	N	N
not	N	N
too	N	N
stony	N	C
,	N	N
which	N	N
helped	N	N
us	N	N
greatly	C	C
.	N	N
	
Soon	N	N
we	N	N
had	N	N
our	N	N
trees	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
holes	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
held	N	N
them	N	N
upright	C	C
as	N	N
we	N	N
scooped	N	C
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
back	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
holes	N	N
with	N	N
our	N	N
trowels	N	C
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
patted	N	C
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
down	N	N
,	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
trees	N	N
were	N	N
upright	C	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
gave	N	N
them	N	N
some	N	N
water	N	N
to	N	N
grow	N	N
on	N	N
.	N	N
	
Soon	N	N
we	N	N
would	N	N
have	N	N
two	N	N
beautiful	N	N
trees	N	N
.	N	N
	
Earth	N	N

in	N	N
America	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
is	N	N
a	N	N
day	N	N
where	N	N
we	N	N
recognize	N	C
the	N	N
environment	C	C
and	N	N
the	N	N
fact	N	N
that	N	N
we	N	N
need	N	N
to	N	N
protect	N	N
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
earth	N	N
day	N	N
my	N	N
friend	N	N
Patrick	N	N
and	N	N
I	N	N
decided	N	N
that	N	N
we	N	N
should	N	N
plant	N	N
a	N	N
tree	N	N
to	N	N
counteract	N	C
the	N	N
effects	N	N
of	N	N
deforesting	N	C
.	N	N
	
To	N	N
do	N	N
this	N	N
we	N	N
first	N	N
dug	N	C
a	N	N
hole	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
twice	N	N
the	N	N
size	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
root	C	C
ball	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
was	N	N
hard	N	N
work	N	N
,	N	N
but	N	N
it	N	N
ensures	N	C
that	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
has	N	N
enough	N	N
loose	N	N
soil	C	C
to	N	N
spread	C	N
its	N	N
roots	C	C
in	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
then	N	N
placed	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
middle	C	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
pit	C	C
we	N	N
had	N	N
dug	N	C
and	N	N
made	N	N
sure	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
centered	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
that	N	N
we	N	N
filled	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
rest	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
pit	C	C
with	N	N
a	N	N
high	N	N
quality	N	N
planting	N	C
soil	C	C
in	N	N
order	N	N
to	N	N
give	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
proper	N	N
nutrition	C	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
the	N	N
soil	C	C
was	N	N
placed	N	N
in	N	N
we	N	N
stepped	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
soil	C	C
to	N	N
compact	N	C
it	N	N
and	N	N
make	N	N
sure	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
stays	N	N
in	N	N
place	N	N
.	N	N
	
It	N	N
felt	N	N
really	N	N
good	N	N
to	N	N
give	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
environment	C	C
instead	N	C
of	N	N
damaging	N	C
it	N	N
.	N	N
	
In	N	N
the	N	N
morning	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
woke	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
prepare	N	C
for	N	N
the	N	N
day	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
getting	N	N
coffee	N	N
ready	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
took	N	N
on	N	N
breakfast	N	N
.	N	N
	
My	N	N
partner	N	N
awoke	N	C
,	N	N
and	N	N
she	N	N
began	N	N
to	N	N
get	N	N
ready	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
bathroom	N	N
.	N	N
	
She	N	N
was	N	N
out	N	N
by	N	N
the	N	N
time	N	N
food	N	N
was	N	N
ready	N	N
.	N	N
	
We	N	N
spoke	N	N
about	N	N
our	N	N
plans	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
day	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
what	N	N
we	N	N
intended	N	C
our	N	N
goals	N	N
to	N	N
be	N	N
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
getting	N	N
dressed	N	N
up	N	N
to	N	N
head	N	N
outside	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
headed	N	N
over	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
gardening	C	C
store	N	N
to	N	N
choose	N	N
a	N	N
tree	N	N
for	N	N
our	N	N
yard	N	N
.	N	N
	
Both	N	N
of	N	N
us	N	N
were	N	N
hoping	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
nice	N	N
Japanese	N	N
Maple	N	C
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
checkout	N	C
lady	N	N
was	N	N
nice	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
found	C	N
exactly	N	N
what	N	N
we	N	N
were	N	N
looking	N	N
for	N	N
after	N	N
we	N	N
got	N	N
into	N	N
the	N	N
store	N	N
.	N	N
	
Driving	N	N
home	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
could	N	N
barely	C	N
contain	N	C
our	N	N
excitement	N	C
.	N	N
	
After	N	N
stepping	N	N
back	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
house	N	N
for	N	N
a	N	N
quick	N	N
snack	N	N
and	N	N
another	N	N
cup	N	N
of	N	N
coffee	N	N
,	N	N
we	N	N
set	N	N
out	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
shed	C	C
to	N	N
get	N	N
the	N	N
right	N	N
tools	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
hole	N	N
was	N	N
easy	N	N
to	N	N
dig	N	N
,	N	N
and	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
was	N	N
transplanted	N	C
successfully	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
travel	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
local	N	N
nursery	C	C
to	N	N
select	N	N
a	N	N
tree	N	N
for	N	N
planting	N	C
,	N	N
today	N	N
I	N	N
have	N	N
decided	N	N
to	N	N
purchase	C	C
a	N	N
flowering	N	C
maple	N	C
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
ensure	C	C
the	N	N
one	N	N
I	N	N
pick	N	N
is	N	N
high	N	N
quality	N	N
with	N	N
no	N	N
rotting	N	C
and	N	N
looks	N	N
healthy	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
yard	N	N
I	N	N
determine	C	C
the	N	N
best	N	N
location	N	N
based	N	N
on	N	N
the	N	N
expected	C	C
height	N	C
it	N	N
will	N	N
grow	N	N
and	N	N
other	N	N
plants	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
yard	N	N
.	N	N
	
With	N	N
my	N	N
garden	N	N
shovel	N	C
I	N	N
dig	N	N
a	N	N
hole	N	N
at	N	N
least	N	N
twice	N	N
the	N	N
size	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
roots	C	C
of	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
ensure	C	C
rocks	N	N
and	N	N
are	N	N
removed	N	C
from	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
put	N	N
plenty	N	N
of	N	N
organic	C	C
matter	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
to	N	N
ensure	C	C
good	N	N
growth	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
gently	C	C
place	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
and	N	N
refill	N	C
with	N	N
the	N	N
shoveled	N	C
dirt	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
place	N	N
my	N	N
garden	N	N
hose	N	C
at	N	N
the	N	N
base	C	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
and	N	N
turn	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
to	N	N
a	N	N
very	N	N
slow	N	N
stream	N	N
so	N	N
it	N	N
will	N	N
absorb	C	C
into	N	N
the	N	N
soil	C	C
properly	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
allow	N	N
the	N	N
water	N	N
to	N	N
run	N	N
for	N	N
about	N	N
and	N	N
hour	N	N
ensuring	N	C
it	N	N
does	N	N
n't	N	N
get	N	N
soggy	N	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
step	N	N
back	N	N
and	N	N
admire	N	C
my	N	N
new	N	N
tree	N	N
and	N	N
envision	C	C
what	N	N
it	N	N
will	N	N
look	N	N
like	N	N
a	N	N
year	N	N
from	N	N
now	N	N
.	N	N
	
A	N	N
few	N	N
years	N	N
ago	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
some	N	N
volunteer	C	C
work	N	N
in	N	N
my	N	N
local	N	N
community	C	C
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
like	N	N
giving	N	N
back	N	N
to	N	N
my	N	N
community	C	C
.	N	N
	
One	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
things	N	N
we	N	N
did	N	N
was	N	N
plant	N	N
trees	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
city	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
was	N	N
my	N	N
first	N	N
experience	N	C
with	N	N
planting	N	C
trees	N	N
.	N	N
	
First	N	N
I	N	N
had	N	N
to	N	N
prepare	N	C
the	N	N
ground	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
soil	C	C
was	N	N
already	N	N
in	N	N
great	N	N
shape	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
so	N	N
that	N	N
part	N	N
was	N	N
taken	N	N
care	N	N
of	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
grabbed	N	N
a	N	N
shovel	N	C
and	N	N
then	N	N
started	N	N
digging	N	C
.	N	N
	
Then	N	N
it	N	N
was	N	N
time	N	N
to	N	N
plan	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
tree	N	N
was	N	N
small	N	N
,	N	N
so	N	N
I	N	N
was	N	N
able	C	N
to	N	N
remove	N	N
it	N	N
from	N	N
the	N	N
pot	N	N
by	N	N
putting	N	N
it	N	N
upside	N	C
down	N	N
.	N	N
	
I	N	N
then	N	N
gently	C	C
placed	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
the	N	N
hole	N	N
and	N	N
then	N	N
filled	N	C
the	N	N
hole	N	N
back	N	N
up	N	N
with	N	N
the	N	N
dirt	N	C
.	N	N
	
The	N	N
next	N	N
thing	N	N
I	N	N
did	N	N
was	N	N
add	N	N
mulch	N	C
around	N	N
the	N	N
area	N	N
of	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
Once	N	N
the	N	N
mulch	N	C
was	N	N
added	N	N
,	N	N
I	N	N
put	N	N
a	N	N
stake	N	C
in	N	N
the	N	N
ground	N	N
and	N	N
tied	N	N
it	N	N
to	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
.	N	N
	
This	N	N
was	N	N
to	N	N
hold	N	N
the	N	N
tree	N	N
in	N	N
place	N	N
as	N	N
it	N	N
grows	N	N
for	N	N
the	N	N
first	N	N
year	N	N
.	N	N
